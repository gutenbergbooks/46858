<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="uc">In</span> the present edition of Crabbe's Poems the general
arrangement adopted is that of the chronological
order of publication. The poem entitled <i>Midnight</i> has
been inserted at a conjectural date as belonging to the
period of the Juvenile Poems (1772-1780); but all other
poems contained in this edition which have hitherto
remained unpublished will be printed after the published
poems, in the sequence of their production so far as this
is ascertainable. With the poems hitherto unpublished
I have also been fortunate enough to obtain permission
to include in a later volume, among other posthumously
printed pieces, the <i>Two Poetical Epistles</i> by Crabbe,
first published, from a manuscript in the collection of
Mr Buxton Forman, in Vol. II of <i>Literary Anecdotes of
the Nineteenth Century</i> edited by W. Robertson Nicoll
and Thomas J. Wise (London, 1896). From the second
of these <i>Epistles</i> were taken, but not in their original
order, the ten lines reproduced in the present volume
from George Crabbe the younger's 1834 edition of his
father's Poems.</p>

<p>The earliest of the Juvenile Poems here printed are
taken from <i>The Lady's Magazine, or Entertaining Companion
for the Fair Sex, appropriated solely to their Use
and Amusement</i>, for the year 1772, printed at London
for Robinson and Roberts, 25 Paternoster Row. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
first volume of this Magazine seems to have been that for
the year 1770, and to have comprised the numbers from
August to December inclusive; but the earlier portion
of this volume had been previously published in the
same year 1770 under the same title by J. Wheble at
20 Paternoster Row, 'by whom letters to the Editor
are requested and received.' This then must be the
'Wheble's Magazine for 1772,' of which George Crabbe
the younger in the Life prefixed to the 1834 edition of
his father's Poems (p. 22) states that he had after long
search discovered a copy. The Magazine seems itself
to have been a revival of an earlier <i>Lady's Magazine</i>,
of which portions of the volumes for 1760 and 1761
are extant, and which, according to the title-page of the
volume for 1761, was printed for J. Wilkie at the Bible
in St Paul's Churchyard.</p>

<p>But the younger Crabbe's account of his father's
verses in 'Wheble's Magazine for 1772' does not tally
with the actual contents of the volume for 1772 of <i>The
Lady's Magazine</i> which has been used for the present
edition. It is possible, of course, though there is no
evidence to support the supposition, that <i>The Lady's
Magazine</i> published by Wheble was continued at all
events till 1772, parallel to <i>The Lady's Magazine</i>
published by Robinson and Roberts, with which in
1770 it had been in some measure blended. It is
equally possible that the younger Crabbe made some
mistake or mistakes. In any case, his statement is, that
Wheble's Magazine for 1772 'contains besides the
prize poem on Hope,' from which he proceeds to quote
the concluding six lines, 'four other pieces, signed
"G. C., Woodbridge, Suffolk," "To Mira," "The
Atheist reclaimed," "The Bee," and "An Allegorical
Fable."' The volume published by Robinson and Roberts
contains no pieces corresponding to these, except that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
its October number there is printed an <i>Essay on Hope</i>,
in which the lines cited by the younger Crabbe and
reprinted, on his authority, in the present edition, do
not appear, but of which the concluding lines seem to
imply that it was a copy of verses written in competition
for a prize. It cannot however be by Crabbe. For it is
signed 'C. C., Rotherhithe, 1772'; and the July number
of the same volume contains a piece of verse of some
length entitled <i>The Rotherhithe Beauties</i> and signed
'C. C., Rotherhithe, July 15,' which is certainly not by
Crabbe; and later in the volume follows another piece
entitled <i>Night</i>, signed 'C. C., Rotherhithe, November 19,
1772,' which likewise cannot be attributed to Crabbe.</p>

<p>On the other hand the 1772 volume of <i>The
Lady's Magazine</i> contains certain pieces of verse which
may without hesitation be assigned to him, and which
are accordingly reprinted in the present edition. These
are, in the September number, <i>Solitude</i> and <i>A Song</i>,
which bear as a signature the quasi-anagram 'G.
EBBARE'; in the October number, the lines <i>To
Emma</i>, with the quasi-anagram 'G. EBBAAC' and
the date 'Suffolk'; and, in the November number,
<i>Despair</i>, <i>Cupid</i>, and a <i>Song</i>, signed with the earlier form
'G. EBBARE.' This <i>Song</i> is followed by some lines in
blank verse <i>On the Wonders of Creation</i>, and, further on,
by some stanzas <i>To Friendship</i>, likewise signed 'C. C.';
but manifestly neither blank verse nor stanzas are by
Crabbe.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that in the October
number in the same volume the following occurs among
the notices <i>To our Correspondents</i>: 'The birth of a
Maccaroni, by Ebbare, in the style of the Scriptures,
seems to be taking too great a liberty with things
sacred; and it is our maxim, as far as possible, to
abstain from every appearance of evil.' The <i>Lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Magazine</i> continued to be published by Robinson and
Roberts for many subsequent years; and it is a curious
coincidence that No. 5 of Vol. <span class="smcap">XLVII</span> (for May, 1816)
contains some stanzas entitled <i>Myra's Wedding-Day</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining <i>Juvenilia</i> printed in the present
edition are partly reproduced from the <i>Fragments of
Verse, from Mr Crabbe's early Note-Books</i> in Vol. <span class="smcap">II</span> of
the 1834 edition, partly from the Life in Vol. <span class="smcap">I</span> of the
same. The lines On the Death of William Springall
Levett are quoted in the latter from Green's <i>History of
Framlingham</i>, which has been compared.</p>

<p>Of the poems which follow in the present volume,
<i>Inebriety</i> is here printed from a copy of the quarto of
1775, which lacks a title-page and which bears on p. 1
the following deprecation in Crabbe's handwriting:
'NB.&mdash;pray let not this be seen at [cipher] there is very
little of it that I'm not heartily asham'd of.' The
imprint of the title-page here given is taken from the
<i>Life</i> (1834, p. 28).</p>

<p><i>Midnight, a Poem</i>, is now first printed from the
original manuscript which formed part of Dawson
Turner's collection, in which it was numbered 121 at
the sale of Dawson Turner's manuscripts in June, 1859.
Its handwriting, as Professor Dowden points out, is identical
with that of a <i>facsimile</i> in a passage from the <i>Two
Epistles</i> mentioned above, given in the <i>Literary Anecdotes
of the Nineteenth Century</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Candidate</i> is printed from the edition of 1834
(Vol. <span class="smcap">II</span>, Appendix). This poem is not included in the
edition of 1823, and after a long quest it has proved
impossible to obtain a copy of the original edition of
1780 (published in quarto by H. Payne, opposite
Marlborough House, Pall Mall). This edition is not in
the British Museum. It was only possible to compare
the forty-six lines of the poem quoted in <i>The Monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Review</i> for September, 1780; but no variants have been
found in these.</p>

<p>The subsequent poems contained in the present
volume are all printed from the edition of 1823, the
last edition published in England in the poet's lifetime.
The <i>Variants</i> enumerated at the close of this volume
are in each case the readings of the first editions of
the several poems, viz., <i>The Library</i>, 1781, <i>The
Village</i>, 1783, <i>The Newspaper</i>, 1785, <i>The Parish Register
&amp;c.</i>, 1807, and <i>The Borough</i>, 1810. The address <i>To
the Reader</i> prefixed to <i>The Newspaper</i>, which does not
appear in the edition of 1823, has been restored from
that of 1785, as it appears in the younger Crabbe's
edition of 1834.</p>

<p>The list of <i>Errata</i> includes all the misprints, slips of
the pen, and unintentional mistakes of spelling or quotation,
which have been found in the texts which have
been reprinted in this volume. The reading substituted
here is in each case enclosed in square brackets. The
list is a long one, for Crabbe was a careless writer;
and in the matter of quotations (as the concluding sentence
of the <i>Preface</i> to <i>The Borough</i> indicates) was not
given to over-conscientiousness. It has seemed permissible,
where this could be done, to supplement the poet's
statements as to the sources of his quotations; but there
are instances in which these statements themselves remain
more or less doubtful. Crabbe's interpunctuation is so
arbitrary, and, though no doubt largely determined by
what might be described as the movement of the writer's
mind, so frequently at variance even with the practice
(it can hardly be called system) which he more usually
follows, that it has been thought right to use as much
freedom on this head as seemed consistent with a due
respect for the author's intention. No alteration has been
made in the matter of interpunctuation which was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
warranted either by the poet's ordinary practice, or by the
primary necessity of making his meaning clear.</p>

<p>As complete as possible a bibliography of Crabbe's
Poems will, it is hoped, be published in the concluding
volume of this edition.</p>

<p>There remains the pleasant duty of thanking those
whose kindness has been of assistance in the preparation
of this volume. The relatives of my dear friend the late
Canon <span class="smcap">Ainger</span> have allowed me to retain for this
purpose the first editions of <i>Inebriety</i> (with Crabbe's
autograph), <i>The Village</i> and <i>The Newspaper</i> which he had
lent me not long before his death. The Vice-Master of
Trinity, Mr <span class="smcap">W. Aldis Wright</span>, besides enabling me to
borrow from Trinity Library the first edition of <i>The
Library</i>, kindly lent his own copy of the <i>Poems</i> published
in 1807. I am indebted to Professor <span class="smcap">Edward Dowden</span>,
LL.D., of Trinity College, Dublin, for various
services generously rendered by him to this edition of
Crabbe, which will benefit from them in its concluding
as it has in its opening volume. He has readily allowed
me to print the whole of the interesting blank verse
poem of <i>Midnight</i>, which, in his own words, 'unless
it be a transcript by Crabbe from some other eighteenth-century
poet, of which there is no evidence, may be
assumed to be of his authorship.'</p>

<p>To the same kind friend, and to the special courtesy
of Mr <span class="smcap">J. W. Lyster</span>, Librarian of the National
Library of Ireland, Kildare Street, Dublin, I owe the
opportunity of tracing <i>fide oculata</i>, so far as it seems
possible to make sure of it, the elusive volume of <i>The
Lady's Magazine</i> containing the earliest of Crabbe's
printed verse.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">A. R. Waller</span>, of Peterhouse, Assistant
Secretary to the Syndics of the University Press, has in
many ways facilitated the preparation of this volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
And without the unstinting and unflagging cooperation
of another member of my College, Mr <span class="smcap">A. T.
Bartholomew</span>, of the University Library, who has
compiled the list of variants, besides giving me much
other assistance, I could not, amidst other engagements,
have carried so far the execution of a delightful task.</p>

<h3 class="tim4">SOLITUDE.</h3>

<p class="subtitle2 tim4">[September, 1772.]</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Free from envy, strife and sorrow,</p>
<p class="i1">Jealous doubts, and heart-felt fears;</p>
<p>Free from thoughts of what to-morrow</p>
<p class="i1">May o'er-charge the soul with <span class="locked">cares&mdash;</span></p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Live I in a peaceful valley,</p>
<p class="i1">By a neighbouring lonely wood;</p>
<p>Giving way to melancholy,</p>
<p class="i1">(Joy, when better understood).</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Near me ancient ruins falling</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p class="i1">From a worn-out castle's brow;           </p>
<p>Once the greatest [chiefs] installing,</p>
<p class="i1">Where are all their honours now?</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Here in midnight's gloomy terror</p>
<p class="i1">I enjoy the silent night;</p>
<p>Darkness shews the soul her error,</p>
<p class="i1">Darkness leads to inward light.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Here I walk in meditation,</p>
<p class="i1">Pond'ring all sublunar things,</p>
<p>From the silent soft persuasion,</p>
<p class="i1">Which from virtue's basis springs.                <span class="linenum">20</span></p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>What, says truth, are pomp and riches?</p>
<p class="i1">Guilded baits to folly lent;</p>
<p>Honour, which the soul bewitches,</p>
<p class="i1">When obtain'd, we may repent.</p>
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</a>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>By me plays the stream meand'ring</p>
<p class="i1">Slowly, as its waters glide;</p>
<p>And, in gentle murmurs wand'ring,</p>
<p class="i1">Lulls to downy rest my pride.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Silent as the gloomy graves are</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p class="i1">Now the mansions once so loud;                  </p>
<p>Still and quiet as the brave, or</p>
<p class="i1">All the horrors of a croud.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>This was once the seat of plunder,</p>
<p class="i1">Blood of heroes stain'd the floor;</p>
<p>Heroes, nature's pride and wonder,</p>
<p class="i1">Heroes heard of now no more.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Owls and ravens haunt the buildings,</p>
<p class="i1">Sending gloomy dread to all;</p>
<p>Yellow moss the summit yielding,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p class="i1">Pellitory decks the wall.                     </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Time with rapid speed still wanders,</p>
<p class="i1">Journies on an even pace;</p>
<p>Fame of greatest actions squanders,</p>
<p class="i1">But perpetuates disgrace.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Sigh not then for pomp or glory;</p>
<p class="i1">What avails a heroe's name?</p>
<p>Future times may tell your story,</p>
<p class="i1">To your then disgrace and shame.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Chuse some humble cot as this is,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p class="i1">In sweet philosophic ease;                    </p>
<p>With dame Nature's frugal blisses</p>
<p class="i1">Live in joy, and die in peace.</p>

<h3>A SONG.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">III.</p>
"Virgins vainly say they're free,

<p>Lovers kind and good may be,</p>
<p class="i1">Husbands may be kinder.</p>

<p class="i5">IV.</p>
<p>"Then shun not wedlock's happy chain,</p>

<p class="i1">Blessings wait on Hymen."</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>But, above all, the <span class="smcap">Poet</span> owns thy <span class="locked">powers&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Hope leads him on, and every fear devours;</p>
<p>He writes, and, unsuccessful, writes again,</p>
<p>Nor thinks the last laborious work in vain;</p>
<p>New schemes he forms, and various plots he tries</p>
<p>To win the laurel, and possess the <span class="smcap">Prize</span>.</p>

<h3>TO EMMA.</h3>


<div class="poetry">

<p>Idle pageant of an hour;</p>
<p>Soon shall time its tints devour,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Early pluck'd, it might produce</p>

<p class="i1">If nature's law's unpaid,</p>

<p class="i1">A cruel frozen maid.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But yield, my fair one, yield to love,</p>
<p class="i1">And joys unnumber'd find,</p>
<p>In Cupid's mystic circle move,</p>

<h2>INEBRIETY.</h2>

<p class="center">[Inebriety, a Poem, in three Parts. Ipswich, printed and
sold by C. Punchard, Bookseller, in the Butter-Market, 1775.
Price one shilling and sixpence.]</p>


<h3>The PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="uc">Presumption</span> or Meanness are but too often the only
articles to be discovered in a Preface. Whilst one author
haughtily affects to despise the public attention, another
timidly courts it. I would no more beg for than disdain
applause, and therefore should advance nothing in Favor of the
following little <i>Poem</i>, did it not appear a Cruelty and disregard
to send a first Production naked into the <span class="smcap">World</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">World</span>!&mdash;how pompous, and yet how trifling the
sound. Every <span class="smcap">Man</span>, Gentle Reader, has a <span class="smcap">World</span> of his own,
&amp; whether it consists of half a score, or half a thousand
Friends, 'tis his, and he loves to boast of it. Into my <span class="smcap">World</span>,
therefore, I commit this, my Muse's earliest labor, nothing
doubting the Clemency of the Climate, nor fearing the Partiality
of the censorious.</p>

<p>Something by way of <i>Apology</i> for this trifle, is perhaps
necessary; especially for those parts, wherein I have taken
such great Liberties with Mr. <span class="smcap">Pope</span>; that Gentleman, secure
in immortal Fame, would forgive me; forgive me too, my
friendly Critic; I promise thee, thou wilt find the Extracts
from the Swan of Thames the best Parts of the Performance;<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</a>
Few, I dare venture to affirm, will pay me so great a Compliment,
as to think I have injured Mr <span class="smcap">Pope</span>; Fewer, I hope, will
think I endeavoured to do it, and Fewest of all will think any
thing about it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ladies</span> will doubtless favor my Attempt; for them
indeed it was principally composed; I have endeavored to
demonstrate that it is their own Faults, if they are not deemed
as good <span class="smcap">Men</span>, as half the masculine World; that a personal
Difference of Sex need not make a real Difference; and that
a tender Languishment, a refin'd Delicacy, and a particular
attention to shine in Dress, will render the <i>Beau-Animal</i>
infinitely more feminine, than the generality of <span class="smcap">Ladies</span>, whatever
arcane Tokens of <i>Manhood</i> the said <i>Animal</i> may be indued
with; and yet, ye <span class="smcap">Fair</span>! these creatures pass even in your
catalogue for <span class="smcap">Men</span>; which I'm afraid is a Demonstration that
the real <span class="smcap">Man</span> is very scarce.</p>

<p>Some grave <i>Head</i> or <i>other</i> may possibly tell me, that Vice
is to be lash'd, not indulg'd; that true <i>Poetry</i> forbids, not
encourages, Folly; and such other wise and weighty Sentences,
picked from <span class="smcap">Pope</span> and <span class="smcap">Horace</span>, as he shall think most appertaining
to his own dignity. But this, my good Reader, is a
trifle; <i>People</i> now a Days are not to be preach'd into Reflection,
or they pay <i>Parsons</i>, not <i>Poets</i> for it, if they were; they listen
indeed to a Discourse from the Pulpit, for <span class="smcap">Men</span> are too wise to
give away their Money without any consideration; and though
they don't mind what is said there, 'tis doubtless a great
Satisfaction to think they might if they choose it; but a <span class="smcap">Man</span>
reads a <i>Poem</i> for quite a different purpose: to be lul'd into ease
from reflection, to be lul'd into an inclination for pleasure, and
(where I confess it comes nearer the Sermon) to be lul'd&mdash;asleep.</p>

<p>But lest the <i>Apology</i> should have the latter effect in itself,
and so take away the merit of the Performance by forestalling
that agreeable Event: I without further ceremony bid thee
Adieu!<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</a></p>

<p>The Heart which hardens, and which rules the Head.</p>
<p>When Winter stern his gloomy front uprears,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>A sable void the barren earth appears;                         </p>
<p>The meads no more their former verdure boast,</p>
<p>Fast bound their streams, and all their Beauty lost;</p>
<p>The herds, the flocks, their icy garments mourn,</p>

<p>The fallen branches from the sapless tree</p>
<p>With glittering fragments strow the glassy way;</p>
<p>From snow-top'd Hills the whirlwinds keenly blow,</p>
<p>Howl through the Woods, and pierce the vales below;</p>
<p>Through the sharp air a flaky torrent flies,</p>

<p>The floating air their downy substance glides</p>
<p>Through springing Waters, and prevents their tides;</p>
<p>Seizes the rolling Waves, and, as a God,</p>
<p>Charms their swift race, and stops the refl'ent flood;</p>
<p>The opening valves, which fill the venal road,</p>

<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>The Tendons stiffen, and the Spirit cools;                     </p>
<p>Each asks the aid of [Nature's] sister Art,</p>
<p>To Cher the senses, and to warm the Heart.</p>
<p>The gentle fair on nervous tea relies,</p>
<p>Whilst gay good-nature sparkles in her eyes;</p>
<p>An inoffensive Scandal fluttering round,</p>
<p>Too rough to tickle, and too light to wound;</p>
<p>Champain the Courtier drinks, the spleen to chase,</p>
<p>The Colonel burgundy, and port his Grace;</p>
<p>Turtle and 'rrack the city rulers charm,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Ale and content the labouring peasants warm;                   </p>
<p>O'er the dull embers happy Colin sits,</p>
<p>Colin, the prince of joke and rural wits;</p>
<p>Whilst the wind whistles through the hollow panes,</p>
<p>He drinks, nor of the rude assault complains;</p>
<p>And tells the Tale, from sire to son retold,</p>
<p>Of spirits vanishing near hidden gold;</p>
<p>Of moon-clad Imps, that tremble by the dew,</p>
<p>Who skim the air, or glide o'er waters blue.</p>
<p>The throng invisible, that doubtless float</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>By mould'ring Tombs, and o'er the stagnant moat;               </p>
<p>Fays dimly glancing on the russet plain,</p>
<p>And all the dreadful nothing of the Green.</p>
<p>And why not these? Less fictious is the tale,</p>
<p>Inspir'd by Hel'con's streams, than muddy ale?</p>
<p>Peace be to such, the happiest and the best,</p>
<p>Who with the forms of fancy urge their jest;</p>
<p>Who wage no war with an Avenger's Rod,</p>
<p>Nor in the pride of reason curse their God.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Aldborough, 1778.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>Give me, ye Powers that rule in gentle hearts,</p>
<p>The full design, complete in all its parts,</p>
<p>Th' enthusiastic glow, that swells the <span class="locked">soul&mdash;</span></p>
<p>When swell'd too much the judgment to <span class="locked">control&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The happy ear that feels the flowing force</p>
<p>Of the smooth line's uninterrupted course;</p>
<p>Give me, oh give, if not in vain the prayer,</p>
<p>That sacred wealth, poetic worth, to <span class="locked">share&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Be it my boast to please and to improve,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>To warm the soul to virtue and to love;                         </p>
<p>To paint the passions, and to teach mankind</p>
<p>Our greatest pleasures are the most refined;</p>
<p>The cheerful tale with fancy to rehearse,</p>
<p>And gild the moral with the charm of verse.</p>

<h3>THE COMPARISON.</h3>

<p class="subtitle">Parham, 1778.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Friendship is like the gold refined,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Life is a Dream;&mdash;it steals upon the Man,</p>
<p>He knows not how, but thinks himself awake;</p>
<p>'Tis like a Bubble dancing on the Deep,</p>
<p>That turns its glossy surface to the Sun,</p>
<p>Catches a Rainbow-Vest, and sparkles, proud</p>
<p>Of momentary Being&mdash;then it <span class="locked">breaks&mdash;</span></p>
<p>To some tremendous Billow drops a prey,</p>
<p>And joins th' eternal Source, from whence it sprang.</p>

<div class="stanza">

<p>Through Star-crown'd Gloom, I sing; inspir'd by her,</p>
<p>Whom Virtue loves, whom Wisdom; from whose Touch</p>

<p>Sits yonder Moon's chaste ray upon the Rock,</p>
<p>That, rising from the Bosom of the Wave,</p>
<p>Flings Awe on Night. Thou Grave-enamour'd Fair,</p>
<p>Attune my Song, and, languid as thou art,</p>
<p>The Song shall please; and I will paint the Dream</p>
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</a>

<h3>TIME.</h3>

<p  class="subtitle2">London, February, 1780.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>"The clock struck one! we take no thought of Time,"</p>

<p>Those vile, mechanic things that rule our hearts,</p>
<p>And cut our lives in momentary parts.</p>

<p>How much in little space they have to do;                       </p>

<p>It tells the ruffian when his comrades wait;</p>
<p>It calls the duns to crowd my hapless gate;</p>

<p>As sweets unshelter'd run to vapid sour.</p>
<p>But thou, the counsel to my closest thought,</p>
<p>Beheld'st it ne'er in fulsome stanzas wrought.</p>
<p>The Muse I court ne'er fawn'd on venal souls,</p>
<p>Whom suppliants angle, and poor praise controls;</p>
<p>She, yet unskill'd in all but fancy's dream,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>

<p>The ready cipher of a trembling <span class="locked">land&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Not of that simple kind that, placed alone,</p>
<p>Are useless, harmless things, and threaten none;</p>
<p>But those which, join'd to figures, well express</p>

<p>Hence rascals teach the virtues they detest,</p>
<p>And fright base action from sin's wavering breast;</p>
<p>For, though the Knave may scorn the Muse's arts,</p>
<p>Her sting may haply pierce more timid hearts.</p>
<p>Some, though they wish it, are not steel'd enough,</p>

<h3>AN INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS OF THE AUTHOR TO HIS POEMS.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Ye idler things, that soothed my hours of care,</p>
<p>Where would ye wander, triflers, tell me where?</p>
<p>As maids neglected, do ye fondly dote</p>
<p>On the fair type, or the embroider'd coat;</p>
<p>Detest my modest shelf, and long to fly,</p>
<p>Where princely <span class="smcap">Popes</span> and mighty <span class="smcap">Miltons</span> lie?</p>
<p>Taught but to sing, and that in simple style,</p>
<p>Of Lycia's lip, and Musidora's smile,</p>
<p>Go, then! and taste a yet unfelt distress,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>The fear that guards the captivating press;                     </p>
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</a>
<p>Whose maddening region should ye once explore,</p>
<p>No refuge yields my tongueless mansion more.</p>
<p>But thus ye'll grieve, Ambition's plumage stript,</p>
<p>"Ah, would to Heaven, we'd died in manuscript!"</p>
<p>Your unsoil'd page each yawning wit shall flee</p>
<p>&mdash;For few will read, and none admire like <span class="locked">me.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Its place, where spiders silent bards enrobe.</p>
<p>Squeezed betwixt Cibber's Odes and Blackmore's Job;</p>
<p>Where froth and mud, that varnish and deform,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Feed the lean critic and the fattening worm;                    </p>
<p>Then sent disgraced&mdash;the unpaid printer's <span class="locked">bane&mdash;</span></p>
<p>To mad Moorfields, or sober Chancery Lane,</p>
<p>On dirty stalls I see your hopes expire,</p>
<p>Vex'd by the grin of your unheeded sire,</p>
<p>Who half reluctant has his care resign'd,</p>
<p>Like a teased parent, and is rashly kind.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Yet rush not all, but let some scout go forth.</p>
<p>View the strange land, and tell us of its worth;</p>
<p>And, should he there barbarian usage meet,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>The patriot scrap shall warn us to retreat.                     </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">And thou, the first of thy eccentric race,</p>
<p>A forward imp, go, search the dangerous place,</p>
<p>Where Fame's eternal blossoms tempt each bard,</p>
<p>Though dragon-wits there keep eternal guard.</p>
<p>Hope not unhurt the golden spoil to seize,</p>
<p>The Muses yield, as the Hesperides;</p>
<p>Who bribes the guardian, all his labour's done,</p>
<p>For every maid is willing to be won.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Before the lords of verse a suppliant stand,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And beg our passage through the fairy land:                     </p>
<p>Beg more&mdash;to search for sweets each blooming field,</p>
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</a>
<p>And crop the blossoms woods and valleys yield;</p>
<p>To snatch the tints that beam on Fancy's bow,</p>
<p>And feel the fires on Genius' wings that glow;</p>
<p>Praise without meanness, without flattery stoop,</p>
<p>Soothe without fear, and without trembling hope.</p>
</div>
</div>


<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="uc">The</span> following Poem being itself of an introductory nature,
its author supposes it can require but little preface.</p>

<p>It is published with a view of obtaining the opinion of the
candid and judicious reader on the merits of the writer as a
poet; very few, he apprehends, being in such cases sufficiently
impartial to decide for themselves.</p>

<p>It is addressed to the Authors of the Monthly Review, as to
critics of acknowledged merit; an acquaintance with whose
labours has afforded the writer of this Epistle a reason for
directing it to them in particular, and, he presumes, will yield
to others a just and sufficient plea for the preference.</p>

<p>Familiar with disappointment, he shall not be much surprised<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</a>
to find he has mistaken his talent. However, if not
egregiously the dupe of his vanity, he promises to his readers
some entertainment, and is assured that, however little in the
ensuing Poem is worthy of applause, there is yet less that
merits contempt.</p>

<h3>
TO THE AUTHORS OF THE MONTHLY
REVIEW.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">The pious pilot, whom the Gods provide,</p>
<p>Through the rough seas the shatter'd bark to guide,</p>
<p>Trusts not alone his knowledge of the deep,</p>
<p>Its rocks that threaten, and its sands that sleep;</p>
<p>But, whilst with nicest skill he steers his way,</p>
<p>The guardian Tritons hear their favourite pray.</p>
<p>Hence borne his vows to Neptune's coral dome,</p>
<p>The God relents, and shuts each gulfy tomb.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Thus as on fatal floods to fame I steer,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>I dread the storm, that ever rattles here;                      </p>
<p>Nor think enough, that long my yielding soul</p>
<p>Has felt the Muse's soft, but strong, control;</p>
<p>Nor think enough that manly strength and ease,</p>
<p>Such as have pleased a friend, will strangers please;</p>
<p>But, suppliant, to the critic's throne I bow,</p>
<p>Here burn my incense, and here pay my vow;</p>
<p>That censure hush'd, may every blast give o'er,</p>
<p>And the lash'd coxcomb hiss contempt no more.</p>
<p>And ye, whom authors dread or dare in vain,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Affecting modest hopes or poor disdain,                         </p>
<p>Receive a bard, who, neither mad nor mean,</p>
<p>Despises each extreme, and sails between;</p>
<p>Who fears; but has, amid his fears confess'd,</p>
<p>The conscious virtue of a Muse oppressed;</p>
<p>A Muse in changing times and stations nursed,</p>
<p>By nature honour'd and by fortune cursed.</p>
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</a>
<p class="i1">No servile strain of abject hope she brings,</p>
<p>Nor soars presumptuous, with unwearied wings;</p>
<p>But, pruned for flight&mdash;the future all her <span class="locked">care&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Would know her strength, and, if not strong, forbear.           </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">The supple slave to regal pomp bows down,</p>
<p>Prostrate to power, and cringing to a crown;</p>
<p>The bolder villain spurns a decent awe,</p>
<p>Tramples on rule, and breaks through every law;</p>
<p>But he whose soul on honest truth relies,</p>
<p>Nor meanly flatters power, nor madly flies.</p>
<p>Thus timid authors bear an abject mind,</p>
<p>And plead for mercy they but seldom find.</p>
<p>Some, as the desperate to the halter run,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Boldly deride the fate they cannot shun;                        </p>
<p>But such there are, whose minds, not taught to stoop,</p>
<p>Yet hope for fame, and dare avow their hope;</p>
<p>Who neither brave the judges of their cause,</p>
<p>Nor beg in soothing strains a brief applause.</p>
<p>And such I'd be;&mdash;and, ere my fate is past,</p>
<p>Ere clear'd with honour, or with culprits cast,</p>
<p>Humbly at Learning's bar I'll state my case,</p>
<p>And welcome then distinction or disgrace!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">When in the man the flights of fancy reign,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Rule in the heart, or revel in the brain,                       </p>
<p>As busy Thought her wild creation apes,</p>
<p>And hangs delighted o'er her varying shapes,</p>
<p>It asks a judgment, weighty and discreet,</p>
<p>To know where wisdom prompts, and where conceit;</p>
<p>Alike their draughts to every scribbler's mind</p>
<p>(Blind to their faults as to their danger blind)&mdash;</p>
<p>We write enraptured, and we write in haste,</p>
<p>Dream idle dreams, and call them things of taste;</p>
<p>Improvement trace in every paltry line,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>And see, transported, every dull design;                        </p>
<p>Are seldom cautious, all advice detest,</p>
<p>And ever think our own opinions best;</p>
<p>Nor shows my Muse a muse-like spirit here,</p>
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</a>
<p>Who bids me pause, before I persevere.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">But she&mdash;who shrinks, while meditating flight</p>
<p>In the wide way, whose bounds delude her sight,</p>
<p>Yet tired in her own mazes still to roam,</p>
<p>And cull poor banquets for the soul at <span class="locked">home&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Would, ere she ventures, ponder on the way,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Lest dangers yet unthought-of flight betray;                    </p>
<p>Lest her Icarian wing, by wits unplumed,</p>
<p>Be robb'd of all the honours she assumed,</p>
<p>And Dulness swell&mdash;a black and dismal sea,</p>
<p>Gaping her grave, while censures madden me.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Such was his fate, who flew too near the sun,</p>
<p>Shot far beyond his strength, and was undone;</p>
<p>Such is his fate, who creeping at the shore</p>
<p>The billow sweeps him, and he's found no more.</p>
<p>Oh! for some God, to bear my fortunes fair</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Midway betwixt presumption and despair!                         </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Has then some friendly critic's former blow</p>
<p>Taught thee a prudence authors seldom know?"</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Not so! their anger and their love untried,</p>
<p>A wo-taught prudence deigns to tend my side:</p>
<p>Life's hopes ill-sped, the Muse's hopes grow poor,</p>
<p>And though they flatter, yet they charm no more;</p>
<p>Experience points where lurking dangers lay,</p>
<p>And as I run, throws caution in my way.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">There was a night, when wintry winds did rage,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Hard by a ruin'd pile I met a sage;                             </p>
<p>Resembling him the time-struck place appear'd,</p>
<p>Hollow its voice, and moss its spreading beard;</p>
<p>Whose fate-lopp'd brow, the bat's and beetle's dome,</p>
<p>Shook, as the hunted owl flew hooting home.</p>
<p>His breast was bronzed by many an eastern blast,</p>
<p>And fourscore winters seem'd he to have past;</p>
<p>His thread-bare coat the supple osier bound,</p>
<p>And with slow feet he press'd the sodden ground;</p>
<p>Where, as he heard the wild-wing'd Eurus blow,</p>
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</a>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>He shook, from locks as white, December's snow;                </p>
<p>Inured to storm, his soul ne'er bid it cease,</p>
<p>But lock'd within him meditated peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Father," I said&mdash;for silver hairs inspire,</p>
<p>And oft I call the bending peasant <span class="locked">Sire&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Tell me, as here beneath this ivy bower,</p>
<p>That works fantastic round its trembling tower,</p>
<p>We hear Heaven's guilt-alarming thunders roar,</p>
<p>Tell me the pains and pleasures of the poor;</p>
<p>For Hope, just spent, requires a sad adieu,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>And Fear acquaints me I shall live with you.                   </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"There was a time when, by Delusion led,</p>
<p>A scene of sacred bliss around me spread;</p>
<p>On Hope's, as Pisgah's lofty top, I stood,</p>
<p>And saw my Canaan there, my promised good.</p>
<p>A thousand scenes of joy the clime bestow'd,</p>
<p>And wine and oil through vision's valleys flow'd;</p>
<p>As Moses his, I call'd my prospect bless'd,</p>
<p>And gazed upon the good I ne'er possess'd:</p>
<p>On this side Jordan doom'd by fate to stand,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Whilst happier Joshuas win the promised land."                 </p>
<p>"Son," said the Sage&mdash;"be this thy care suppressed;</p>
<p>The state the Gods shall choose thee is the best:</p>
<p>Rich if thou art, they ask thy praises more,</p>
<p>And would thy patience, when they make thee poor.</p>
<p>But other thoughts within thy bosom reign,</p>
<p>And other subjects vex thy busy brain;</p>
<p>Poetic wreaths thy vainer dreams excite,</p>
<p>And thy sad stars have destined thee to write.</p>
<p>Then, since that task the ruthless fates decree,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>

<p class="i1">"Be not too eager in the arduous Chase:</p>
<p>Who pants for triumph seldom wins the race;</p>

<p>Some happier scrap capricious wits may find</p>
<p>On a fair day, and be profusely kind;</p>
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</a>
<p>Which, buried in the rubbish of a throng,</p>
<p>Had pleased as little as a new-year's song,</p>
<p>Or lover's verse, that cloy'd with nauseous sweet,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Or birth-day ode, that ran on ill-pair'd feet.                 </p>
<p>Merit not always&mdash;Fortune feeds the bard,</p>
<p>And, as the whim inclines, bestows reward;</p>
<p>None without wit, nor with it numbers gain;</p>
<p>To please is hard, but none shall please in vain.</p>
<p>As a coy mistress is the humour'd town,</p>
<p>Loth every lover with success to crown;</p>
<p>He who would win must every effort try,</p>
<p>Sail in the mode, and to the fashion fly;</p>
<p>Must gay or grave to every humour dress,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>And watch the lucky Moment of Success;                         </p>

<p>Mira's alone a softer lustre bear,</p>

<div class="linenum">160</div>

<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</a>
<p>Transported Fancy there her stores imprest;</p>
<p>The soul in varied raptures learn'd to fly,</p>
<p>Felt all their force, and never question'd why.</p>
<p>No idle doubts could then her peace molest;</p>
<p>She found delight, and left to heaven the rest.</p>
<p>Soft joys in Evening's placid shades were born,</p>
<p>And where sweet fragrance wing'd the balmy morn.</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>When the wild thought roved vision's circuit o'er,             </p>
<p>And caught the raptures, caught, alas! no more:</p>
<p>No care did then a dull attention ask,</p>
<p>For study pleased, and that was every task;</p>
<p>No guilty dreams stalk'd that heaven-favour'd round,</p>
<p>Heaven-guarded too; no Envy entrance found;</p>
<p>Nor numerous wants, that vex advancing age,</p>
<p>Nor Flattery's silver'd tale, nor Sorrow's sage;</p>
<p>Frugal Affliction kept each growing dart,</p>
<p>T' o'erwhelm in future days the bleeding heart.</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>No sceptic art veil'd Pride in Truth's disguise,               </p>
<p>But prayer, unsoil'd of doubt, besieged the skies;</p>
<p>Ambition, avarice, care, to man retired,</p>
<p>Nor came desires more quick, than joys desired.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">A summer morn there was, and passing fair;</p>

</p>

<p class="tip2"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="tip4">That the longest poem in this collection was
honoured by the notice of your Lordship's right honourable
and ever-valued relation, Mr. <span class="smcap">Fox</span>; that it should be the last
which engaged his attention; and that some parts of it were
marked with his approbation: are circumstances productive of
better hopes of ultimate success than I had dared to entertain
before I was gratified with a knowledge of them; and the hope
thus raised leads me to ask permission that I may dedicate this
book to your Lordship, to whom that truly great and greatly
lamented personage was so nearly allied in family, so closely
bound in affection, and in whose mind presides the same critical
taste which he exerted to the delight of all who heard him.
He doubtless united with his unequalled abilities a fund of
good-nature; and this possibly led him to speak favourably of,
and give satisfaction to writers, with whose productions he<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</a>
might not be entirely satisfied; nor must I allow myself to
suppose his desire of obliging was withholden, when he honoured
any effort of mine with his approbation. But, my Lord, as there
was discrimination in the opinion he gave; as he did not veil
indifference for insipid mediocrity of composition under any
general expression of cool approval: I allow myself to draw a
favourable conclusion from the verdict of one who had the
superiority of intellect few would dispute, which he made
manifest by a force of eloquence peculiar to himself; whose
excellent judgment no one of his friends found cause to distrust,
and whose acknowledged candour no enemy had the temerity
to deny.</p>

<p>With such encouragement, I present my book to your
Lordship: the Account of the <i>Life and Writings of Lopez de
Vega</i> has taught me what I am to expect; I there perceive how
your Lordship can write, and am there taught how you can
judge of writers: my faults, however numerous, I know will
none of them escape through inattention, nor will any merit be
lost for want of discernment; my verses are before him who
has written elegantly, who has judged with accuracy, and who
has given unequivocal proof of abilities in a work of difficulty&mdash;a
translation of poetry, which few persons in this kingdom are
able to read, and in the estimation of talents not hitherto justly
appreciated. In this view, I cannot but feel some apprehension;
but I know also, that your Lordship is apprised of the great
difficulty of writing well; that you will make much allowance
for failures, if not too frequently repeated; and, as you can
accurately discern, so you will readily approve, all the better
and more happy efforts of one who places the highest value
upon your Lordship's approbation, and who has the honour
to be,</p>

<p class="tipr50">My <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="tipr40">Your Lordship's most faithful<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</a></p>

<p class="tipr45">and obliged humble servant,</p>

<p class="tipr55">GEO. CRABBE.</p>


<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="uc">About</span> twenty-five years since was published a poem called
"The Library," which, in no long time, was followed by
two others, "The Village," and "The Newspaper." These,
with a few alterations and additions, are here reprinted; and
are accompanied by a poem of greater length, and several shorter
attempts, now, for the first time, before the public; whose
reception of them creates in their author something more than
common solicitude, because he conceives that, with the judgment
to be formed of these latter productions, upon whatever may be
found intrinsically meritorious or defective, there will be united
an inquiry into the relative degree of praise or blame which they
may be thought to deserve, when compared with the more
early attempts of the same writer.</p>

<p>And certainly, were it the principal employment of a man's
life to compose verses, it might seem reasonable to expect that
he would continue to improve as long as he continued to live;
though, even then, there is some doubt whether such improvement
would follow, and perhaps proof might be adduced to
show it would not. But when, to this "<i>idle trade</i>" is added
some "<i>calling</i>," with superior claims upon his time and attention,
his progress in the art of versification will probably be in proportion
neither to the years he has lived, nor even to the
attempts he has made.</p>

<p>While composing the first-published of these poems, the<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</a>
author was honoured with the notice and assisted by the advice
of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; part of it was
written in his presence, and the whole submitted to his judgment;
receiving, in its progress, the benefit of his correction.
I hope, therefore, to obtain pardon of the reader, if I eagerly
seize the occasion, and, after so long a silence, endeavour to
express a grateful sense of the benefits I have received from this
gentleman, who was solicitous for my more essential interests,
as well as benevolently anxious for my credit as a writer.</p>

<p>I will not enter upon the subject of his extraordinary
abilities; it would be vanity, it would be weakness, in me to
believe that I could make them better known or more admired
than they now are. But of his private worth, of his wishes to
do good, of his affability and condescension; his readiness to
lend assistance when he knew it was wanted, and his delight to
give praise where he thought it was deserved: of these I may
write with some propriety. All know that his powers were
vast, his acquirements various; and I take leave to add, that he
applied them with unremitted attention to those objects which
he believed tended to the honour and welfare of his country.
But it may not be so generally understood that he was ever
assiduous in the more private duties of a benevolent nature; that
he delighted to give encouragement to any promise of ability,
and assistance to any appearance of desert. To what purposes he
employed his pen, and with what eloquence he spake in the
senate, will be told by many, who yet may be ignorant of the
solid instruction, as well as the fascinating pleasantry, found in
his common conversation, amongst his friends, and his affectionate
manners, amiable disposition, and zeal for their happiness,
which he manifested in the hours of retirement with his family.</p>

<p>To this gentleman I was indebted for my knowledge of
Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was as well known to his friends for
his perpetual fund of good-humour and his unceasing wishes to
oblige, as he was to the public for the extraordinary productions
of his pencil and his pen. By him I was favoured with an
introduction to Doctor Johnson, who honoured me with his
notice, and assisted me, as Mr. Boswell has told, with remarks
and emendations for a poem I was about to publish. The<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</a>
doctor had been often wearied by applications, and did not
readily comply with requests for his opinion: not from any
unwillingness to oblige, but from a painful contention in his
mind between a desire of giving pleasure and a determination
to speak truth. No man can, I think, publish a work without
some expectation of satisfying those who are to judge of its
merit; but I can, with the utmost regard to veracity, speak
my fears, as predominating over every pre-indulged thought
of a more favourable nature, when I was told that a judge so
discerning had consented to read and give his opinion of "The
Village," the poem I had prepared for publication. The time
of suspense was not long protracted; I was soon favoured with
a few words from Sir Joshua, who observed, "If I knew how
cautious Doctor Johnson was in giving commendation, I should
be well satisfied with the portion dealt to me in his letter."
Of that letter the following is a copy:</p>

<div class="tipr10 mb2">
<p class="tip2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="tip6">"I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe's poem, which
I read with great delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.
The alterations which I have made, I do not require him to
adopt; for my lines are, perhaps, not often better [than] his
own: but he may take mine and his own together, and
perhaps, between them, produce something better than
either.&mdash;He is not to think his copy wantonly defaced; a
wet sponge will wash all the red lines away, and leave the
pages clean.&mdash;His Dedication will be least liked: it were
better to contract it into a short sprightly address.&mdash;I do not
doubt of Mr. Crabbe's success.</p>

<p class="tip6">"I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="tip12">"SAM. JOHNSON."</p>
<p class="tip2">"<i>March</i> 4, 1783."</p>
</div>


<p>That I was fully satisfied, my readers will do me the justice
to believe; and I hope they will pardon me, if there should
appear to them any impropriety in pub<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</a>lishing the favourable
opinion expressed in a private letter: they will judge, and truly,
that by so doing, I wish to bespeak their good opinion, but have
no design of extorting their applause. I would not hazard an
appearance so ostentatious to gratify my vanity, but I venture
to do it in compliance with my fears.</p>

<p>After these was published "The Newspaper": it had not
the advantage of such previous criticism from any friends, nor
perhaps so much of my own attention as I ought to have given
to it; but the impression was disposed of, and I will not pay so
little respect to the judgment of my readers as now to suppress
they then approved.</p>

<p>Since the publication of this poem more than twenty years
have elapsed, and I am not without apprehension, lest so long
a silence should be construed into a blamable neglect of my
own interest, which those excellent friends were desirous of
promoting; or, what is yet worse, into a want of gratitude for
their assistance, since it becomes me to suppose, they considered
these first attempts as promises of better things, and their favours
as stimulants to future exertion. And here, be the construction
put upon my apparent negligence what it <i>may</i>, let me not
suppress my testimony to the liberality of those who are looked
up to as patrons and encouragers of literary merit, or indeed of
merit of any kind: their patronage has never been refused, I
conceive, when it has been reasonably expected or modestly
required; and it would be difficult, probably, to instance, in
these times and in this country, any one who merited or was
supposed to merit assistance, but who nevertheless languished
in obscurity or necessity for want of it; unless in those cases
where it was prevented by the resolution of impatient pride, or
wearied by the solicitations of determined profligacy. And,
while the subject is before me, I am unwilling to pass silently
over the debt of gratitude which I owe to the memory of two
deceased noblemen, His Grace the late Duke of Rutland, and
the Right Honourable the Lord Thurlow: sensible of the
honour done me by their notice, and the benefits received from
them, I trust this acknowledgment will be imputed to its only
motive, a grateful sense of their favours.</p>

<p>Upon this subject I could dwell with much pleasure; but,<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</a>
to give a reason for that appearance of neglect, as it is more
difficult, so, happily, it is less required. In truth, I have, for
many years, intended a republication of these poems, as soon as
I should be able to join with them such other of later date as
might not deprive me of the little credit the former had obtained.
Long indeed has this purpose been procrastinated; and, if the
duties of a profession, not before pressing upon me&mdash;if the
claims of a situation, at that time untried&mdash;if diffidence of my
own judgment, and the loss of my earliest friends, will not
sufficiently account for my delay, I must rely upon the good-nature
of my reader, that he will let them avail as far as he can,
and find an additional apology in my fears of his censure.</p>

<p>These fears being so prevalent with me, I determined not
to publish any thing more, unless I could first obtain the
sanction of such an opinion as I might with some confidence
rely upon. I looked for a friend who, having the discerning
taste of Mr. Burke, and the critical sagacity of Doctor Johnson,
would bestow upon my MS. the attention requisite to form his
opinion, and would then favour me with the result of his observations;
and it was my singular good fortune to gain such
assistance; the opinion of a critic so qualified, and a friend so
disposed to favour me. I had been honoured by an introduction
to the Right Honourable Charles James Fox some years before,
at the seat of Mr. Burke; and, being again with him, I received
a promise that he would peruse any work I might send to him
previous to its publication, and would give me his opinion. At
that time, I did not think myself sufficiently prepared; and
when, afterwards, I had collected some poems for his inspection,
I found my right honourable friend engaged by the affairs of
a great empire, and struggling with the inveteracy of a fatal
disease; at such time, upon such mind, ever disposed to oblige
as that mind was, I could not obtrude the petty business of
criticising verses; but he remembered the promise he had kindly
given, and repeated an offer, which, though I had not presumed
to expect, I was happy to receive. A copy of the poems, now
first published, was immediately sent to him, and (as I have the
information from Lord Holland, and his Lordship's permission
to inform my readers) the poem which I have named "The
Parish Register" was heard by Mr. Fox, and it excited inte<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</a>rest
enough, by some of its parts, to gain for me the benefit of his
judgment upon the whole. Whatever he approved, the reader
will readily believe, I have carefully retained; the parts he
disliked are totally expunged, and others are substituted, which
I hope resemble those, more conformable to the taste of so
admirable a judge. Nor can I deny myself the melancholy
satisfaction of adding, that this poem (and more especially the
story of Ph&oelig;be Dawson, with some parts of the second book),
were the last compositions of their kind that engaged and
amused the capacious, the candid, the benevolent mind of this
great man.</p>

<p>The above information I owe to the favour of the Right
Honourable Lord Holland; nor this only, but to his Lordship
I am indebted for some excellent remarks upon the other parts
of my MS. It was not indeed my good fortune then to know
that my verses were in the hands of a nobleman who had given
proof of his accurate judgment as a critic, and his elegance as
a writer, by favouring the public with an easy and spirited
translation of some interesting scenes of a dramatic poet, not
often read in this kingdom. The Life of Lopez de Vega was
then unknown to me; I had, in common with many English
readers, heard of him, but could not judge whether his far-extended
reputation was caused by the sublime efforts of a
mighty genius, or the unequalled facility of a rapid composer,
aided by peculiar and fortunate circumstances. That any part
of my MS. was honoured by the remarks of Lord Holland
yields me a high degree of satisfaction, and his Lordship will
perceive the use I have made of them; but I must feel some
regret when I know to what small portion they were limited;
and discerning, as I do, the taste and judgment bestowed upon
the verses of Lopez de Vega, I must perceive how much my
own needed the assistance afforded to one who cannot be
sensible of the benefit he has received.</p>

<p>But how much soever I may lament the advantages lost, let
me remember with gratitude the helps I have obtained. With
a single exception, every poem in the ensuing collection has
been submitted to the critical sagacity of a gentleman, upon
whose skill and candour their author could rely. To publis<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</a>h
by advice of friends has been severely ridiculed, and that too by
a poet, who probably, without such advice, never made public
any verses of his own: in fact, it may not be easily determined
who acts with less discretion, the writer who is encouraged to
publish his works, merely by the advice of friends whom he
consulted, or he who, against advice, publishes from the sole
encouragement of his own opinion. These are deceptions to
be carefully avoided; and I was happy to escape the latter, by
the friendly attentions of the Reverend Richard Turner, minister
of Great Yarmouth. To this gentleman I am indebted more
than I am able to describe, or than he is willing to allow, for
the time he has bestowed upon the attempts I have made.
He is, indeed, the kind of critic for whom every poet should
devoutly wish, and the friend whom every man would be happy
to acquire; he has taste to discern all that is meritorious, and
sagacity to detect whatsoever should be discarded; he gives just
the opinion an author's wisdom should covet, however his vanity
might prompt him to reject it; what altogether to expunge and
what to improve he has repeatedly taught me, and, could I have
obeyed him in the latter direction, as I invariably have in the
former, the public would have found this collection more worthy
its attention, and I should have sought the opinion of the critic
more void of apprehension.</p>

<p>But whatever I may hope or fear, whatever assistance I
have had or have needed, it becomes me to leave my verses to
the judgment of the reader, without my endeavour to point out
their merit, or an apology for their defects. Yet as, among the
poetical attempts of one who has been for many years a priest,
it may seem a want of respect for the legitimate objects of his
study, that nothing occurs, unless it be incidentally, of the great
subjects of religion: so it may appear a kind of ingratitude of a
beneficed clergyman, that he has not employed his talent (be it
estimated as it may) to some patriotic purpose&mdash;as in celebrating
the unsubdued spirit of his countrymen in their glorious resistance
of those enemies, who would have no peace throughout
the world, except that which is dictated to the drooping spirit
of suffering humanity by the triumphant insolence of military
success.</p>
<p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</a></p>
<p>Credit will be given to me, I hope, when I affirm that
subjects so interesting have the due weight with me, which
the sacred nature of the one, and the national importance
of the other, must impress upon every mind not seduced into
carelessness for religion by the lethargic influence of a perverted
philosophy, nor into indifference for the cause of our country by
hyperbolical or hypocritical professions of universal philanthropy;
but, after many efforts to satisfy myself by various trials on these
subjects, I declined all further attempt, from a conviction that
I should not be able to give satisfaction to my readers. Poetry
of religious nature must indeed ever be clogged with almost
insuperable difficulty; but there are doubtless to be found
poets who are well qualified to celebrate the unanimous and
heroic spirit of our countrymen, and to describe in appropriate
colours some of those extraordinary scenes, which have been
and are shifting in the face of Europe, with such dreadful
celerity; and to such I relinquish the duty.</p>

<p>It remains for me to give the reader a brief view of those
articles in the following collection, which for the first time
solicit his attention.</p>

<p>In the "Parish Register," he will find an endeavour once
more to describe village-manners, not by adopting the notion of
pastoral simplicity or assuming ideas of rustic barbarity, but by
more natural views of the peasantry, considered as a mixed
body of persons, sober or profligate, and hence, in a great
measure, contented or miserable. To this more general
description are added the various characters which occur in
the three parts of a Register: Baptism, Marriages, and Burials.</p>

<p>If the "Birth of Flattery" offer no moral, as an appendage
to the fable, it is hoped that nothing of an immoral, nothing
of improper, tendency will be imputed to a piece of poetical
playfulness. In fact, genuine praise, like all other species of
truth, is known by its bearing full investigation: it is what
the giver is happy that he can justly bestow, and the receiver
conscious that he may boldly accept; but adulation must ever
be afraid of inquiry, and must, in proportion to their degrees
of moral sensibility,</p>

<p class="center small">Be shame "to him that gives and him that takes."</p>

<p><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</a></p>

<p>The verses in page[s 234-7] want a title; nor does the
motto, although it gave occasion to them, altogether express the
sense of the writer, who meant to observe that some of our best
acquisitions, and some of our nobler conquests, are rendered
ineffectual, by the passing away of opportunity, and the changes
made by time: an argument that such acquirements and moral
habits are reserved for a state of being in which they have the
uses here denied them.</p>

<p>In the story of "Sir Eustace Grey," an attempt is made to
describe the wanderings of a mind first irritated by the consequences
of error and misfortune, and afterwards soothed by a
species of enthusiastic conversion, still keeping him insane: a
task very difficult, and, if the presumption of the attempt may
find pardon, it will not be refused to the failure of the poet.
It is said of our Shakspeare, respecting madness,</p>

<p class="center small">"In that circle none dare walk but he."</p>

<p>Yet be it granted to one who dares not to pass the boundary
fixed for common minds, at least to step near to the tremendous
verge, and form some idea of the terrors that are stalking in the
interdicted space.</p>

<p>When first I had written "Aaron, or The Gipsy," I had
no unfavourable opinion of it; and, had I been collecting my
verses at that time for publication, I should certainly have
included this tale. Nine years have since elapsed, and I
continue to judge the same of it, thus literally obeying one
of the directions given by the prudence of criticism to the
eagerness of the poet; but how far I may have conformed to
rules of more importance must be left to the less partial
judgment of the readers.</p>

<p>The concluding poem, entitled "Woman!" was written at
the time when the quotation from Mr. Ledyard was first made
public; the expression has since become hackneyed; but the
sentiment is congenial with our feelings, and though somewhat
amplified in these verses, it is hoped they are not so far extended
as to become tedious.<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</a></p>

<p>After this brief account of his subjects, the author leaves
them to their fate, not presuming to make any remarks upon
the kinds of versification he has chosen, or the merit of the
execution. He has indeed brought forward the favourable
opinion of his friends, and for that he earnestly hopes his
motives will be rightly understood; it was a step of which
he felt the advantage while he foresaw the danger; he was
aware of the benefit, if his readers would consider him as one
who puts on a defensive armour against hasty and determined
severity; but he feels also the hazard, lest they should suppose
he looks upon himself to be guarded by his friends, and so
secure in the defence, that he may defy the fair judgment of
legal criticism. It will probably be said, "he has brought
with him his testimonials to the bar of the public," and he
must admit the truth of the remark; but he begs leave to
observe in reply, that of those who bear testimonials of any
kind the greater numbers feel apprehension, and not security:
they are indeed so far from the enjoyment of victory, of the
exultation of triumph, that, with all they can do for themselves,
with all their friends have done for them, they are, like him, in
dread of examination, and in fear of disappointment.<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</a></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When the sad soul, by care and grief oppress'd,</p>
<p>Looks round the world, but looks in vain for rest;</p>
<p>When every object that appears in view,</p>
<p>Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too:</p>
<p>Where shall affliction from itself retire?</p>
<p>Where fade away and placidly expire?</p>
<p>Alas! we fly to silent scenes in vain;</p>
<p>Care blasts the honours of the flow'ry plain:</p>
<p>Care veils in clouds the sun's meridian beam,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Sighs through the grove and murmurs in the stream.              </p>
<p>For, when the soul is labouring in despair,</p>
<p>In vain the body breathes a purer air:</p>
<p>No storm-toss'd sailor sighs for slumbering <span class="locked">seas&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He dreads the tempest, but invokes the breeze;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>On the smooth mirror of the deep resides                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Reflected wo, and o'er unruffled tides                         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The ghost of every former danger glides.                       </p>
<p>Thus, in the calms of life, we only see</p>
<p>A steadier image of our misery;</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>But lively gales and gently-clouded skies                       </p>
<p>Disperse the sad reflections as they rise;</p>
<p>And busy thoughts and little cares avail</p>
<p>To ease the mind, when rest and reason fail.</p>
<p>When the dull thought, by no designs employ'd,</p>
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</a>
<p>Dwells on the past, or suffer'd or enjoy'd,</p>
<p>We bleed anew in every former grief,</p>
<p>And joys departed furnish no relief.</p>
<p class="i1">Not Hope herself, with all her flattering art,</p>
<p>Can cure this stubborn sickness of the heart:</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>The soul disdains each comfort she prepares,                    </p>
<p>And anxious searches for congenial <span class="locked">cares&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Those lenient cares, which, with our own combined,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>By mix'd sensations ease th' afflicted mind.                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And steal our grief away and leave their own behind:           </p>
<p>A lighter grief! which feeling hearts endure</p>
<p>Without regret, nor e'en demand a cure.</p>
<p class="i1">But what strange art, what magic can dispose</p>
<p>The troubled mind to change its native woes?</p>
<p>Or lead us willing from ourselves, to see</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Others more wretched, more undone than we?                      </p>
<p>This, books can do&mdash;nor this alone: they give</p>
<p>New views to life, and teach us how to live;</p>
<p>They soothe the grieved, the stubborn they chastise;</p>
<p>Fools they admonish, and confirm the wise.</p>
<p>Their aid they yield to all: they never shun</p>
<p>The man of sorrow, nor the wretch undone;</p>
<p>Unlike the hard, the selfish, and the proud,</p>
<p>They fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd;</p>
<p>Nor tell to various people various things,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>But show to subjects, what they show to kings.                  </p>
<p class="i1">Come, Child of Care! to make thy soul serene,</p>
<p>Approach the treasures of this tranquil scene;</p>
<p>Survey the dome, and, as the doors unfold,</p>
<p>The soul's best cure in all her cares behold!</p>
<p>Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find,</p>
<p>And mental physic the diseased in mind.</p>
<p>See here the balms that passion's wounds assuage;</p>
<p>See coolers here, that damp the fire of rage;</p>
<p>Here alt'ratives by slow degrees control</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>The chronic habits of the sickly soul;                          </p>
<p>And round the heart, and o'er the aching head,</p>
<p>Mild opiates here their sober influence shed.</p>
<p>Now bid thy soul man's busy scenes exclude,</p>
<p>And view composed this silent <span class="locked">multitude:&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</a>
<p>Silent they are, but, though deprived of sound,</p>
<p>Here all the living languages abound,</p>
<p>Here all that live no more; preserved they lie,</p>
<p>In tombs that open to the curious eye.</p>
<p class="i1">Bless'd be the gracious Power, who taught mankind</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>To stamp a lasting image of the mind!&mdash;                         </p>
<p>Beasts may convey, and tuneful birds may sing,</p>
<p>Their mutual feelings in the opening spring;</p>
<p>But man alone has skill and power to send</p>
<p>The heart's warm dictates to the distant friend;</p>
<p>'Tis his alone to please, instruct, advise</p>
<p>Ages remote, and nations yet to rise.</p>
<p class="i1">In sweet repose, when labour's children sleep,</p>
<p>When joy forgets to smile and care to weep,</p>
<p>When passion slumbers in the lover's breast,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>And fear and guilt partake the balm of rest&mdash;                   </p>
<p>Why then denies the studious man to share</p>
<p>Man's common good, who feels his common care?</p>
<p class="i1">Because the hope is his, that bids him fly</p>
<p>Night's soft repose, and sleep's mild power defy;</p>
<p>That after-ages may repeat his praise,</p>
<p>And fame's fair meed be his for length of days.</p>
<p>Delightful prospect! when we leave behind</p>
<p>A worthy offspring of the fruitful mind,</p>
<p>Which, born and nursed through many an anxious day,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Shall all our labour, all our care repay.                       </p>
<p class="i1">Yet all are not these births of noble kind,</p>
<p>Not all the children of a vigorous mind;</p>
<p>But, where the wisest should alone preside,</p>
<p>The weak would rule us, and the blind would guide;</p>
<p>Nay, man's best efforts taste of man, and show</p>
<p>The poor and troubled source from which they flow:</p>
<p>Where most he triumphs, we his wants perceive,</p>
<p>And for his weakness in his wisdom grieve.</p>
<p>But, though imperfect all, yet wisdom loves</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>This seat serene, and virtue's self approves;                  </p>
<p>Here come the grieved, a change of thought to find,</p>
<p>The curious here, to feed a craving mind;</p>
<p>Here the devout their peaceful temple choose;</p>
<p>And here the poet meets his favouring muse.</p>
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</a>
<p class="i1">With awe around these silent walks I tread:</p>
<p>These are the lasting mansions of the <span class="locked">dead.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"The dead," methinks, a thousand tongues reply;</p>
<p>"These are the tombs of such as cannot die!</p>
<p>Crown'd with eternal fame, they sit sublime,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>And laugh at all the little strife of time."                   </p>
<p class="i1">Hail, then, immortals! ye who shine above,</p>
<p>Each in his sphere the literary Jove;</p>
<p>And ye, the common people of these skies,</p>
<p>A humbler crowd of nameless deities:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis yours to lead the willing mind</p>
<p>Through history's mazes, and the turnings find;</p>
<p>Or whether, led by science, ye retire,</p>
<p>Lost and bewilder'd in the vast desire;</p>
<p>Whether the Muse invites you to her bowers,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>And crowns your placid brows with living flowers;              </p>
<p>Or godlike wisdom teaches you to show</p>
<p>The noblest road to happiness below;</p>
<p>Or men and manners prompt the easy page</p>
<p>To mark the flying follies of the age:</p>
<p>Whatever good ye boast, that good impart;</p>
<p>Inform the head and rectify the heart!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Lo! all in silence, all in order stand;</p>

<p>But now, when Reason has assumed her throne,</p>
<p>She, in her turn, demands to reign alone;</p>
<p>Rejecting all that lies beyond her view,</p>
<p>And, being judge, will be a witness too.</p>
<p>Insulted Faith then leaves the doubtful mind,</p>
<p>To seek for truth, without a power to find;</p>
<p>Ah! when will both in friendly beams unite,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>And pour on erring man resistless light?                       </p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Next to the seats, well stored with works divine,</p>
<p>An ample space, <span class="smcap">Philosophy</span>! is thine;</p>
<p>Our reason's guide, by whose assisting light</p>
<p>We trace the moral bounds of wrong and right;</p>
<p>Our guide through nature, from the sterile clay,</p>
<p>To the bright orbs of yon celestial way!</p>
<p>'Tis thine, the great, the golden chain to trace,</p>
<p>Which runs through all, connecting race with race;</p>
<p>Save where those puzzling, stubborn links remain,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>Which thy inferior light pursues in vain:&mdash;                    </p>
<p class="i1">How vice and virtue in the soul contend;</p>
<p>How widely differ, yet how nearly blend!</p>
<p>What various passions war on either part,</p>
<p>And now confirm, now melt the yielding heart;</p>
<p>How Fancy loves around the world to stray,</p>
<p>While Judgment slowly picks his sober way!</p>
<p>The stores of memory, and the flights sublime</p>
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</a>
<p>Of genius, bound by neither space nor <span class="locked">time&mdash;</span></p>
<p>All these divine Philosophy explores,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Till, lost in awe, she wonders and adores.                     </p>
<p>From these, descending to the earth, she turns,</p>
<p>And matter, in its various form, discerns;</p>
<p>She parts the beamy light with skill profound,</p>
<p>Metes the thin air, and weighs the flying sound;</p>
<p>'Tis hers the lightning from the clouds to call,</p>
<p>And teach the fiery mischief where to fall.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet more her volumes teach&mdash;on these we look</p>
<p>As abstracts drawn from Nature's larger book:</p>
<p>Here, first described, the torpid earth appears,</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>And next, the vegetable robe it wears:                         </p>
<p>Where flow'ry tribes, in valleys, fields and groves,</p>
<p>Nurse the still flame, and feed the silent <span class="locked">loves&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Loves, where no grief, nor joy, nor bliss, nor pain,</p>
<p>Warm the glad heart or vex the labouring brain;</p>
<p>But as the green blood moves along the blade,</p>
<p>The bed of Flora on the branch is made;</p>
<p>Where, without passion, love instinctive lives,</p>
<p>And gives new life, unconscious that it gives.</p>
<p>Advancing still in Nature's maze, we trace,</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>In dens and burning plains, her savage race;                   </p>
<p>With those tame tribes who on their lord attend,</p>
<p>And find in man, a master and a friend;</p>
<p>Man crowns the scene, a world of wonders new,</p>
<p>A moral world, that well demands our view.</p>
<p class="i1">This world is here; for, of more lofty kind,</p>
<p>These neighbouring volumes reason on the mind;</p>
<p>They paint the state of man, ere yet endued</p>
<p>With knowledge&mdash;man, poor, ignorant, and rude;</p>
<p>Then, as his state improves, their pages swell,</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>And all its cares, and all its comforts, tell:                 </p>
<p>Here we behold how inexperience buys,</p>
<p>At little price, the wisdom of the wise;</p>
<p>Without the troubles of an active state,</p>
<p>Without the cares and dangers of the great,</p>
<p>Without the miseries of the poor, we know</p>
<p>What wisdom, wealth, and poverty bestow;</p>
<p>We see how reason calms the raging mind,</p>
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</a>
<p>And how contending passions urge mankind.</p>
<p>Some, won by virtue, glow with sacred fire;</p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>Some, lured by vice, indulge the low desire;                   </p>
<p>Whilst others, won by either, now pursue</p>
<p>The guilty chase, now keep the good in view;</p>
<p>For ever wretched, with themselves at strife,</p>
<p>They lead a puzzled, vex'd, uncertain life;</p>
<p>For transient vice bequeaths a lingering pain,</p>
<p>Which transient virtue seeks to cure in vain.</p>

<p>The huge abridgments of the <span class="smcap">Law</span> abide.</p>
<p>Fruitful as vice the dread correctors stand,</p>
<p>And spread their guardian terrors round the land;</p>

<p>"Ah! happy age," the youthful poet sings,</p>

<p>They dwelt at liberty, and love was law!"</p>
<p class="i1">"Mistaken youth! each nation first was rude,</p>
<p>Each man a cheerless son of solitude,</p>

<p>None felt a care that was not all his own;</p>

<p>A slave, with slaves his monarch's throne he raised,</p>

<p>Their virtue lost, and of their triumphs vain,</p>
<div class="linenum">490</div>
<p>Lo! how they sunk to slavery again!                            </p>
<p>Satiate with power, of fame and wealth possess'd,</p>

<p>The headlong course, that madd'ning heroes run,</p>
<p>How soon triumphant, and how soon undone;</p>
<p>How slaves, turn'd tyrants, offer crowns to sale,</p>
<div class="linenum">500</div>

<p>Old pious tracts, and Bibles bound in wood:</p>

<div class="linenum">510</div>
<p>Her anger swells, her terror chills the soul;                  </p>
<p>She makes the vile to virtue yield applause,</p>

<p class="i1">Not thus her sister <span class="smcap">Comedy</span> prevails,</p>

<p>Yet well the Muse portrays in fancied scenes</p>
<p>What pride will stoop to, what profession means;</p>
<p>How formal fools the farce of state applaud;</p>
<p>How caution watches at the lips of fraud;</p>
<p>The wordy variance of domestic life;</p>
<p>The tyrant husband, the retorting wife,</p>

<div class="linenum">530</div>
<p>Each gentle passion, each becoming grace;                      </p>
<p>The social joy in life's securer road,</p>

<p>And taste the largest portion ere they go.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Pensive I spoke, and cast mine eyes around;</p>
<p>The roof, methought, return'd a solemn sound;</p>
<p>Each column seem'd to shake, and clouds, like smoke,</p>
<p>From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke;</p>
<p>Gathering above, like mists condensed they seem,</p>
<p>Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream;</p>
<p>Like flowing robes they now appear, and twine</p>
<div class="linenum">630</div>
<p>Round the large members of a form divine;                      </p>

<p>His piercing eye, that inward light express'd,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Were seen&mdash;but clouds and darkness veil'd the rest.            </p>
<p>Fear chill'd my heart: to one of mortal race,</p>
<p>How awful seem'd the Genius of the place!</p>
<p>So, in Cimmerian shores, Ulysses saw</p>
<p>His parent-shade, and shrunk in pious awe;</p>
<p>Like him I stood, and wrapt in thought profound,</p>
<p>When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn <span class="locked">sound:&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">640</div>
<p class="i1">"Care lives with all; no rules, no precepts save     </p>

<p>Grief is to man as certain as the grave:                       </p>
<p>Tempests and storms in life's whole progress rise,</p>
<p>And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies;</p>
<p>Some drops of comfort on the favour'd fall,</p>
<p>But showers of sorrow are the lot of <i>all</i>:</p>
<p>Partial to talents, then, shall Heav'n withdraw</p>
<p>Th' afflicting rod, or break the general law?</p>
<p>Shall he who soars, inspired by loftier views,</p>

<p>Life's little cares and little pains refuse?                   </p>
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</a>
<p>Shall he not rather feel a double share</p>
<p>Of mortal wo, when doubly arm'd to bear?</p>
<p class="i1">"Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind</p>
<p>On the precarious mercy of mankind;</p>
<p>Who hopes for wild and visionary things,</p>
<p>And mounts o'er unknown seas with vent'rous wings:</p>

<p>The human race, some portion goes to all:</p>
<p>To him perhaps the milder lot's assign'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">660</div>
<p>Who feels his consolation in his mind;                         </p>
<p>And, lock'd within his bosom, bears about</p>
<p>A mental charm for every care without.</p>
<p>E'en in the pangs of each domestic grief,</p>
<p>Or health or vigorous hope affords relief;</p>
<p>And every wound the tortured bosom feels,</p>
<p>Or virtue bears, or some preserver heals;</p>
<p>Some generous friend, of ample power possess'd;</p>
<p>Some feeling heart that bleeds for the distress'd;</p>
<p>Some breast that glows with virtues all divine;</p>
<div class="linenum">670</div>
<p>Some noble RUTLAND, Misery's friend and thine.                 </p>
<p class="i1">"Nor say, the Muse's song, the Poet's pen,</p>
<p>Merit the scorn they meet from little men.</p>
<p>With cautious freedom if the numbers flow,</p>
<p>Not wildly high, nor pitifully low;</p>
<p>If vice alone their honest aims oppose,</p>
<p>Why so ashamed their friends, so loud their foes?</p>
<p>Happy for men in every age and clime,</p>
<p>If all the sons of vision dealt in rhyme!</p>
<p>Go on then, Son of Vision! still pursue</p>
<div class="linenum">680</div>
<p>Thy airy dreams; the world is dreaming too.                    </p>
<p>Ambition's lofty views, the pomp of state,</p>
<p>The pride of wealth, the splendour of the great,</p>
<p>Stripp'd of their mask, their cares and troubles known,</p>
<p>Are visions far less happy than thy own:</p>
<p>Go on! and, while the sons of care complain,</p>
<p>Be wisely gay and innocently vain;</p>
<p>While serious souls are by their fears undone,</p>
<p>Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun,</p>
<p>And call them worlds! and bid the greatest show</p>
<div class="linenum">690</div>
<p>More radiant colours in their worlds below;                    </p>
<p>Then, as they break, the slaves of care reprove,</p>

<h3>THE VILLAGE.</h3>

<p class="subtitle3">IN TWO BOOKS.<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</a></p>


<h4>BOOK I.</h4>

<p class="summary">The Subject proposed&mdash;Remarks upon Pastoral Poetry&mdash;A Tract of
Country near the Coast described&mdash;An impoverished Borough&mdash;Smugglers
and<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</a> their Assistants&mdash;Rude Manners of the Inhabitants&mdash;Ruinous
Effects of a high Tide&mdash;The Village Life more generally
considered: Evils of it&mdash;The youthful Labourer&mdash;The old Man: his
Soliloquy&mdash;The Parish Workhouse: its Inhabitants&mdash;The sick Poor:
their Apothecary&mdash;The dying Pauper&mdash;The Village Priest.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">The Village Life, and every care that reigns</p>
<p>O'er youthful peasants and declining swains;</p>
<p>What labour yields, and what, that labour past,</p>
<p>Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;</p>
<p>What form the real picture of the poor,</p>
<p>Demand a song&mdash;the Muse can give no more.</p>
<p class="i1">Fled are those times when, in harmonious strains,</p>
<p>The rustic poet praised his native plains.</p>
<p>No shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Their country's beauty or their nymphs' rehearse;               </p>
<p>Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,</p>
<p>Still in our lays fond Corydons complain,</p>
<p>And shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal,</p>
<p>The only pains, alas! they never feel.</p>
<p class="i1">On Mincio's banks, in Cæsar's bounteous reign,</p>
<p>If Tityrus found the Golden Age again,</p>
<p>Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,</p>
<p>Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?</p>
<p>From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?                   </p>
<p class="i1">Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,</p>
<p>Because the Muses never knew their pains.</p>
<p>They boast their peasants' pipes; but peasants now</p>
<p>Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough;</p>
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</a>
<p>And few, amid the rural-tribe, have time</p>
<p>To number syllables, and play with rhyme;</p>
<p>Save honest Duck, what son of verse could share</p>
<p>The poet's rapture, and the peasant's care?</p>
<p>Or the great labours of the field degrade,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>With the new peril of a poorer trade?                           </p>
<p class="i1">From this chief cause these idle praises spring,</p>
<p>That themes so easy few forbear to sing;</p>
<p>For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask:</p>
<p>To sing of shepherds is an easy task.</p>
<p>The happy youth assumes the common strain,</p>
<p>A nymph his mistress, and himself a swain;</p>
<p>With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,</p>
<p>But all; to look like her, is painted fair.</p>
<p class="i1">I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>For him that grazes or for him that farms;                      </p>
<p>But, when amid such pleasing scenes I trace</p>
<p>The poor laborious natives of the place,</p>
<p>And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,</p>
<p>On their bare heads and dewy temples play;</p>
<p>While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,</p>
<p>Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts:</p>
<p>Then shall I dare these real ills to hide</p>
<p>In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?</p>
<p class="i1">No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Which neither groves nor happy valleys boast;                   </p>
<p>Where other cares than those the Muse relates,</p>
<p>And other shepherds dwell with other mates;</p>
<p>By such examples taught, I paint the Cot,</p>
<p>As Truth will paint it, and as Bards will not:</p>
<p>Nor you, ye poor, of letter'd scorn complain,</p>
<p>To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;</p>
<p>O'ercome by labour, and bow'd down by time,</p>
<p>Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?</p>
<p>Can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>By winding myrtles round your ruin'd shed?                      </p>
<p>Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower,</p>
<p>Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,</p>
<p>Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;</p>
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</a>
<p>From thence a length of burning sand appears,</p>
<p>Where the thin harvest waves its wither'd ears;</p>
<p>Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,</p>
<p>Reign o'er the land, and rob the blighted rye:</p>
<p>There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>And to the ragged infant threaten war;                          </p>
<p>There poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil;</p>
<p>There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;</p>
<p>Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,</p>
<p>The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;</p>
<p>O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,</p>
<p>And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade;</p>
<p>With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,</p>
<p>And a sad splendour vainly shines around.</p>
<p>So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Betray'd by man, then left for man to scorn;                    </p>
<p>Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose,</p>
<p>While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;</p>
<p>Whose outward splendour is but folly's dress,</p>
<p>Exposing most, when most it gilds distress.</p>
<p class="i1">Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,</p>
<p>With sullen wo display'd in every face;</p>
<p>Who far from civil arts and social fly,</p>
<p>And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.</p>
<p class="i1">Here too the lawless merchant of the main</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Draws from his plough th' intoxicated swain;                    </p>
<p>Want only claim'd the labour of the day,</p>
<p>But vice now steals his nightly rest away.</p>
<p class="i1">Where are the swains, who, daily labour done,</p>
<p>With rural games play'd down the setting sun;</p>
<p>Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,</p>
<p>Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall;</p>
<p>While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,</p>
<p>Engaged some artful stripling of the throng,</p>
<p>And fell beneath him, foil'd, while far around</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Hoarse triumph rose, and rocks return'd the sound?             </p>
<p>Where now are these?&mdash;Beneath yon cliff they stand,</p>
<p>To show the freighted pinnace where to land;</p>
<p>To load the ready steed with guilty haste;</p>
<p>To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste;</p>
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</a>
<p>Or, when detected in their straggling course,</p>
<p>To foil their foes by cunning or by force;</p>
<p>Or, yielding part (which equal knaves demand),</p>
<p>To gain a lawless passport through the land.</p>
<p class="i1">Here, wand'ring long amid these frowning fields,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>I sought the simple life that Nature yields;                   </p>
<p>Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp'd her place,</p>
<p>And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;</p>
<p>Who, only skill'd to take the finny tribe,</p>
<p>The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe,</p>
<p>Wait on the shore, and, as the waves run high,</p>
<p>On the tost vessel bend their eager eye,</p>
<p>Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way;</p>
<p>[Their], or the ocean's, miserable prey.</p>
<p class="i1">As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>And wait for favouring winds to leave the land,                </p>
<p>While still for flight the ready wing is spread:</p>
<p>So waited I the favouring hour, and <span class="locked">fled&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,</p>
<p>And cried, Ah! hapless they who still remain;</p>
<p>Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,</p>
<p>Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;</p>
<p>Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,</p>
<p>Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;</p>
<p>When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>And begs a poor protection from the poor!                      </p>
<p class="i1">But these are scenes where Nature's niggard hand</p>
<p>Gave a spare portion to the famish'd land;</p>
<p>Hers is the fault, if here mankind complain</p>
<p>Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain.</p>
<p>But yet in other scenes, more fair in view,</p>
<p>Where Plenty smiles&mdash;alas! she smiles for <span class="locked">few&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>And those who taste not, yet behold her store,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The wealth around them makes them doubly poor                  </p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p class="i1">Or will you deem them amply paid in health,       </p>
<p>Labour's fair child, that languishes with wealth?</p>
<p>Go, then! and see them rising with the sun,</p>
<p>Through a long course of daily toil to run;</p>
<p>See them beneath the dog-star's raging heat,</p>
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</a>
<p>When the knees tremble and the temples beat;</p>
<p>Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er</p>
<p>The labour past, and toils to come explore;</p>
<p>See them alternate suns and showers engage,</p>
<p>And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,              </p>
<p>When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;</p>
<p>Then own that labour may as fatal be</p>
<p>To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee.</p>
<p class="i1">Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride</p>
<p>Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;</p>
<p>There may you see the youth of slender frame</p>
<p>Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame;</p>
<p>Yet, urged along, and proudly loth to yield,</p>
<p>He strives to join his fellows of the field;</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Till long-contending nature droops at last,                    </p>
<p>Declining health rejects his poor repast,</p>
<p>His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,</p>
<p>And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell,</p>
<p>Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;</p>
<p>Or will you praise that homely, healthy fare,</p>
<p>Plenteous and plain, that happy peasants share?</p>
<p>Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,</p>
<p>Nor mock the misery of a stinted <span class="locked">meal&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Homely, not wholesome; plain, not plenteous; such              </p>
<p>As you who praise would never deign to touch.</p>
<p class="i1">Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,</p>
<p>Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;</p>
<p>Go! if the peaceful cot your praises share,</p>
<p>Go, look within, and ask if peace be there:</p>
<p>If peace be his&mdash;that drooping weary sire,</p>
<p>Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire;</p>
<p>Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand</p>
<p>Turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand!</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p class="i1">Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these         </p>
<p>Life's latest comforts, due respect and ease:</p>
<p>For yonder see that hoary swain, whose age</p>
<p>Can with no cares except his own engage;</p>
<p>Who, propp'd on that rude staff, looks up to see</p>
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</a>
<p>The bare arms broken from the withering tree,</p>
<p>On which, a boy, he climb'd the loftiest bough,</p>
<p>Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now.</p>
<p class="i1">He once was chief in all the rustic trade;</p>
<p>His steady hand the straightest furrow made;</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Full many a prize he won, and still is proud                   </p>
<p>To find the triumphs of his youth allow'd.</p>
<p>A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes;</p>
<p>He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:</p>
<p>For now he journeys to his grave in pain;</p>
<p>The rich disdain him, nay, the poor disdain;</p>
<p>Alternate masters now their slave command,</p>
<p>Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand;</p>
<p>And, when his age attempts its task in vain,</p>
<p>With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p class="i1">Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,      </p>
<p>His winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;</p>
<p>Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow</p>
<p>O'er his white locks and bury them in snow,</p>
<p>When, roused by rage and muttering in the morn,</p>
<p>He mends the broken hedge with icy <span class="locked">thorn:&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Why do I live, when I desire to be</p>
<p>At once from life and life's long labour free?</p>
<p>Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,</p>
<p>Without the sorrows of a slow decay;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>I, like yon wither'd leaf, remain behind,                      </p>
<p>Nipp'd by the frost, and shivering in the wind;</p>
<p>There it abides till younger buds come on,</p>
<p>As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone;</p>
<p>Then, from the rising generation thrust,</p>
<p>It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust.</p>
<p class="i1">"These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,</p>
<p>Are others' gain, but killing cares to me:</p>
<p>To me the children of my youth are lords,</p>
<p>Cool in their looks, but hasty in their words:</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Wants of their own demand their care; and who                  </p>
<p>Feels his own want and succours others too?</p>
<p>A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,</p>
<p>None need my help, and none relieve my wo;</p>
<p>Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,</p>
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</a>
<p>And men forget the wretch they would not aid!"</p>
<p class="i1">Thus groan the old, till, by disease oppress'd,</p>
<p>They taste a final wo, and then they rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor,</p>
<p>Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,               </p>
<p>And the dull wheel hums doleful through the <span class="locked">day&mdash;</span></p>
<p>There children dwell, who know no parents' care;</p>
<p>Parents, who know no children's love, dwell there!</p>
<p>Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,</p>
<p>Forsaken wives, and mothers never wed;</p>
<p>Dejected widows with unheeded tears,</p>
<p>And crippled age with more than childhood fears;</p>
<p>The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!</p>
<p>The moping idiot and the madman gay.</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Here too the sick their final doom receive,                    </p>
<p>Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,</p>
<p>Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,</p>
<p>Mix'd with the clamours of the crowd below;</p>
<p>Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,</p>
<p>And the cold charities of man to man:</p>
<p>Whose laws indeed for ruin'd age provide,</p>
<p>And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;</p>
<p>But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,</p>
<p>And pride embitters what it can't deny.</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p class="i1">Say ye, oppress'd by some fantastic woes,        </p>
<p>Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;</p>
<p>Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance</p>
<p>With timid eye to read the distant glance;</p>
<p>Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease,</p>
<p>To name the nameless ever-new disease;</p>
<p>Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,</p>
<p>Which real pain, and that alone, can <span class="locked">cure&mdash;</span></p>
<p>How would ye bear in real pain to lie,</p>
<p>Despised, neglected, left alone to die?</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>How would ye bear to draw your latest breath,                  </p>
<p>Where all that's wretched paves the way for death?</p>
<p class="i1">Such is that room which one rude beam divides,</p>
<p>And naked rafters form the sloping sides;</p>
<p>Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,</p>
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</a>
<p>And lath and mud are all that lie between,</p>
<p>Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patch'd, gives way</p>
<p>To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day.</p>
<p>Here, on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread,</p>
<p>The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>For him no hand the cordial cup applies,                       </p>
<p>Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;</p>
<p>No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,</p>
<p>Or promise hope till sickness wears a smile.</p>
<p class="i1">But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,</p>
<p>Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls.</p>
<p>Anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,</p>
<p>All pride and business, bustle and conceit;</p>
<p>With looks unalter'd by these scenes of wo,</p>
<p>With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>He bids the gazing throng around him fly,                      </p>
<p>And carries fate and physic in his eye:</p>
<p>A potent quack, long versed in human ills,</p>
<p>Who first insults the victim whom he kills;</p>
<p>Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy Bench protect.</p>
<p>And whose most tender mercy is neglect.</p>
<p class="i1">Paid by the parish for attendance here,</p>
<p>He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;</p>
<p>In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies,</p>
<p>Impatience mark'd in his averted eyes;</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,                       </p>
<p>Without reply, he rushes on the door.</p>
<p>His drooping patient, long inured to pain,</p>
<p>And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;</p>
<p>He ceases now the feeble help to crave</p>
<p>Of man; and silent sinks into the grave.</p>
<p class="i1">But ere his death some pious doubts arise,</p>
<p>Some simple fears, which "bold bad" men despise:</p>
<p>Fain would he ask the parish-priest to prove</p>
<p>His title certain to the joys above;</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>For this he sends the murmuring nurse, who calls               </p>
<p>The holy stranger to these dismal walls;</p>
<p>And doth not he, the pious man, appear,</p>
<p>He, "passing rich with forty pounds a year"?</p>
<p>Ah! no; a shepherd of a different stock,</p>
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</a>
<p>And far unlike him, feeds this little flock:</p>
<p>A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's task</p>
<p>As much as God or man can fairly ask;</p>
<p>The rest he gives to loves and labours light,</p>
<p>To fields the morning, and to feasts the night;</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>None better skill'd the noisy pack to guide,                   </p>
<p>To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;</p>
<p>A sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,</p>
<p>And, skill'd at whist, devotes the night to play.</p>
<p>Then, while such honours bloom around his head,</p>
<p>Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bed,</p>
<p>To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal</p>
<p>To combat fears that e'en the pious feel?</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">Now once again the gloomy scene explore,       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o'er,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>The man of many sorrows sighs no more.&mdash;                       </p>
<p>Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow</p>
<p>The bier moves winding from the vale below;</p>
<p>There lie the happy dead, from trouble free,</p>
<p>And the glad parish pays the frugal fee.</p>
<p>No more, O Death! thy victim starts to hear</p>
<p>Churchwarden stern, or kingly overseer;</p>
<p>No more the farmer claims his humble bow,</p>
<p>Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!</p>
<p class="i1">Now to the church behold the mourners come,</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb;                             </p>
<p>The village children now their games suspend,</p>
<p>To see the bier that bears their ancient friend:</p>
<p>For he was one in all their idle sport,</p>
<p>And like a monarch ruled their little court;</p>
<p>The pliant bow he form'd, the flying ball,</p>
<p>The bat, the wicket, were his labours all;</p>
<p>Him now they follow to his grave, and stand</p>
<p>Silent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand;</p>
<p>While bending low, their eager eyes explore</p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>The mingled relics of the parish poor.                         </p>
<p>The bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round,</p>

<p>Fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound;</p>
<p>The busy priest, detain'd by weightier care,</p>
<p>Defers his duty till the day of prayer;</p>

<h4>BOOK II.</h4>

<p class="summary">There are found, amid the Evils of a laborious Life, some Views of
Tranquillity and Happiness&mdash;The Repose and Pleasure of a Summer
Sabbath: interrupted by Intoxication and Dispute&mdash;Village Detraction&mdash;Complaints
of the 'Squire&mdash;The Evening Riots&mdash;Justice&mdash;Reasons
for<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</a> this unpleasant View of Rustic Life: the Effect it should

peculiar Distresses: Exemplified in the Life and heroic Death of Lord
Robert Manners&mdash;Concluding Address to His Grace the Duke of
Rutland.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">No longer truth, though shown in verse, disdain,</p>
<p>But own the Village Life a life of pain.</p>
<p>I too must yield, that oft amid these woes</p>
<p>Are gleams of transient mirth and hours of sweet repose,</p>
<p>Such as you find on yonder sportive Green,</p>
<p>The 'squire's tall gate and churchway-walk between;</p>
<p>Where loitering stray a little tribe of friends,</p>
<p>On a fair Sunday when the sermon ends.</p>
<p>Then rural beaux their best attire put on,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>To win their nymphs, as other nymphs are won;                   </p>
<p>While those long wed go plain, and, by degrees,</p>
<p>Like other husbands, quit their care to please.</p>
<p>Some of the sermon talk, a sober crowd,</p>
<p>And loudly praise, if it were preach'd aloud;</p>
<p>Some on the labours of the week look round,</p>
<p>Feel their own worth, and think their toil renown'd;</p>
<p>While some, whose hopes to no renown extend,</p>
<p>Are only pleased to find their labours end.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus, as their hours glide on, with pleasure fraught,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Their careful masters brood the painful thought;                </p>
<p>Much in their mind they murmur and lament,</p>
<p>That one fair day should be so idly spent;</p>
<p>And think that Heaven deals hard, to tithe their store</p>
<p>And tax their time for preachers and the poor.</p>
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</a>
<p class="i1">Yet still, ye humbler friends, enjoy your hour,</p>
<p>This is your portion, yet unclaim'd of power;</p>
<p>This is Heaven's gift to weary men oppress'd,</p>
<p>And seems the type of their expected rest.</p>
<p>But yours, alas! are joys that soon decay;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Frail joys, begun and ended with the day;                       </p>
<p>Or yet, while day permits those joys to reign,</p>
<p>The village vices drive them from the plain.</p>
<p class="i1">See the stout churl, in drunken fury great,</p>
<p>Strike the bare bosom of his teeming mate!</p>
<p>His naked vices, rude and unrefined,</p>
<p>Exert their open empire o'er the mind;</p>
<p>But can we less the senseless rage despise,</p>
<p>Because the savage acts without disguise?</p>
<p class="i1">Yet here disguise, the city's vice, is seen,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And Slander steals along and taints the Green:                  </p>
<p>At her approach domestic peace is gone,</p>
<p>Domestic broils at her approach come on;</p>
<p>She to the wife the husband's crime conveys,</p>
<p>She tells the husband when his consort strays,</p>
<p>Her busy tongue through all the little state</p>
<p>Diffuses doubt, suspicion, and debate;</p>
<p>Peace, tim'rous goddess! quits her old domain,</p>
<p>In sentiment and song content to reign.</p>
<p class="i1">Nor are the nymphs that breathe the rural air</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>So fair as Cynthia's, nor so chaste as fair:                    </p>
<p>These to the town afford each fresher face,</p>
<p>And the clown's trull receives the peer's embrace;</p>
<p>From whom, should chance again convey her down,</p>
<p>The peer's disease in turn attacks the clown.</p>
<p class="i1">Here too the 'squire, or 'squire-like farmer, talk,</p>
<p>How round their regions nightly pilferers walk;</p>
<p>How from their ponds the fish are borne, and all</p>
<p>The rip'ning treasures from their lofty wall;</p>
<p>How meaner rivals in their sports delight,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Just rich enough to claim a doubtful right;                     </p>
<p>Who take a licence round their fields to stray,</p>
<p>A mongrel race! the poachers of the day.</p>
<p class="i1">And hark! the riots of the Green begin,</p>
<p>That sprang at first from yonder noisy inn;</p>
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</a>
<p>What time the weekly pay was vanish'd all,</p>
<p>And the slow hostess scored the threatening wall;</p>
<p>What time they ask'd, their friendly feast to close,</p>
<p>A final cup, and that will make them foes;</p>
<p>When blows ensue that break the arm of toil,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>And rustic battle ends the boobies' broil.                      </p>
<p class="i1">Save when to yonder Hall they bend their way,</p>
<p>Where the grave justice ends the grievous fray;</p>
<p>He who recites, to keep the poor in awe,</p>
<p>The law's vast volume&mdash;for he knows the <span class="locked">law:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>To him with anger or with shame repair</p>
<p>The injured peasant and deluded fair.</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! at his throne the silent nymph appears,</p>
<p>Frail by her shape, but modest in her tears;</p>
<p>And while she stands abash'd, with conscious eye,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Some favourite female of her judge glides by,                   </p>
<p>Who views with scornful glance the strumpet's fate,</p>
<p>And thanks the stars that made her keeper great;</p>
<p>Near her the swain, about to bear for life</p>
<p>One certain evil, doubts 'twixt war and wife;</p>
<p>But, while the falt'ring damsel takes her oath,</p>
<p>Consents to wed, and so secures them both.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, why, you ask, these humble crimes relate,</p>
<p>Why make the poor as guilty as the great?</p>
<p>To show the great, those mightier sons of pride,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>How near in vice the lowest are allied;                         </p>
<p>Such are their natures and their passions such,</p>
<p>But these disguise too little, those too much:</p>
<p>So shall the man of power and pleasure see</p>
<p>In his own slave as vile a wretch as he;</p>
<p>In his luxurious lord the servant find</p>
<p>His own low pleasures and degenerate mind:</p>
<p>And each in all the kindred vices trace</p>
<p>Of a poor, blind, bewilder'd, erring race;</p>
<p>Who, a short time in varied fortune past,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Die, and are equal in the dust at last.                        </p>
<p class="i1">And you, ye poor, who still lament your fate,</p>
<p>Forbear to envy those you call the great;</p>
<p>And know, amid those blessings they possess,</p>
<p>They are, like you, the victims of distress;</p>
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</a>
<p>While sloth with many a pang torments her slave,</p>
<p>Fear waits on guilt, and danger shakes the brave.</p>
<p class="i1">Oh! if in life one noble chief appears,</p>
<p>Great in his name, while blooming in his years;</p>
<p>Born to enjoy whate'er delights mankind,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>And yet to all you feel or fear resign'd;                      </p>
<p>Who gave up joys and hopes, to you unknown,</p>
<p>For pains and dangers greater than your own:</p>
<p>If such there be, then let your murmurs cease,</p>
<p>Think, think of him, and take your lot in peace.</p>
<p class="i1">And such there was:&mdash;Oh! grief, that checks our pride!</p>
<p>Weeping we say, there was&mdash;for Manners died:</p>
<p>Beloved of Heaven, these humble lines forgive,</p>
<p>That sing of Thee<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, and thus aspire to live.</p>
<p class="i1">As the tall oak, whose vigorous branches form</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>An ample shade and brave the wildest storm,                    </p>
<p>High o'er the subject wood is seen to grow,</p>
<p>The guard and glory of the trees below;</p>
<p>Till on its head the fiery bolt descends,</p>
<p>And o'er the plain the shatter'd trunk extends;</p>
<p>Yet then it lies, all wond'rous as before,</p>
<p>And still the glory, though the guard no more:</p>
<p class="i1">So <span class="smcap">THOU</span>, when every virtue, every grace,</p>
<p>Rose in thy soul, or shone within thy face;</p>
<p>When, though the son of Granby, thou wert known</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Less by thy father's glory than thy own;                       </p>
<p>When Honour loved and gave thee every charm,</p>
<p>Fire to thy eye and vigour to thy arm;</p>
<p>Then from our lofty hopes and longing eyes,</p>
<p>Fate and thy virtues call'd thee to the skies;</p>
<p>Yet still we wonder at thy tow'ring fame,</p>
<p>And, losing thee, still dwell upon thy name.</p>
<p class="i1">Oh! ever honour'd, ever valued! say,</p>
<p>What verse can praise thee, or what work repay?</p>
<p>Yet verse (in all we can) thy worth repays,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Nor trusts the tardy zeal of future days;&mdash;                    </p>
<p>Honours for thee thy country shall prepare,</p>
<p>Thee in their hearts, the good, the brave shall bear;</p>
<p>To deeds like thine shall noblest chiefs aspire,</p>
<p>The Muse shall mourn thee, and the world admire.</p>
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</a>
<p class="i1">In future times, when, smit with Glory's charms,</p>
<p>The untried youth first quits a father's <span class="locked">arms;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Oh! be like him," the weeping sire shall say;</p>
<p>"Like Manners walk, who walk'd in Honour's way;</p>
<p>In danger foremost, yet in death sedate,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Oh! be like him in all things, but his fate!"                  </p>
<p class="i1">If for that fate such public tears be shed,</p>
<p>That Victory seems to die now <span class="smcap">THOU</span> art dead;</p>
<p>How shall a friend his nearer hope resign,</p>
<p>That friend a brother, and whose soul was thine?</p>
<p>By what bold lines shall we his grief express,</p>
<p>Or by what soothing numbers make it less?</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis not, I know, the chiming of a song,</p>
<p>Nor all the powers that to the Muse belong,</p>
<p>Words aptly cull'd and meanings well express'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Can calm the sorrows of a wounded breast;                      </p>
<p>But Virtue, soother of the fiercest pains,</p>
<p>Shall heal that bosom, Rutland, where she reigns.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet hard the task to heal the bleeding heart,</p>
<p>To bid the still-recurring thoughts depart,</p>
<p>Tame the fierce grief and stem the rising sigh,</p>
<p>And curb rebellious passion with reply;</p>
<p>Calmly to dwell on all that pleased before,</p>
<p>And yet to know that all shall please no <span class="locked">more&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Oh! glorious labour of the soul, to save</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Her captive powers, and bravely mourn the brave.               </p>
<p class="i1">To such these thoughts will lasting comfort <span class="locked">give&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Life is not measured by the time we live:</p>
<p>'Tis not an even course of threescore years,</p>
<p>A life of narrow views and paltry fears,</p>
<p>Gray hairs and wrinkles and the cares they bring,</p>
<p>That take from death the terrors or the sting;</p>
<p>But 'tis the gen'rous spirit, mounting high</p>
<p>Above the world, that native of the sky;</p>
<p>The noble spirit, that, in dangers brave,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Calmly looks on, or looks beyond the grave:&mdash;                  </p>
<p>Such Manners was, so he resign'd his breath,</p>
<p>If in a glorious, then a timely death.</p>
<p class="i1">Cease then that grief, and let those tears subside;</p>
<p>If Passion rule us, be that passion pride;</p>
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</a>
<p>If Reason, Reason bids us strive to raise</p>
<p>Our fallen hearts, and be like him we praise;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Or, if Affection still the soul subdue,                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Bring all his virtues, all his worth in view,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And let Affection find its comfort too:                        </p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>For how can Grief so deeply wound the heart,                   </p>
<p>When Admiration claims so large a part?</p>
<p class="i1">Grief is a foe; expel him, then, thy soul;</p>
<p>Let nobler thoughts the nearer views control!</p>
<p>Oh! make the age to come thy better care;</p>
<p>See other Rutlands, other Granbys there!</p>
<p>And, as thy thoughts through streaming ages glide,</p>
<p>See other heroes die as Manners died:</p>
<p>And, from their fate, thy race shall nobler grow,</p>
<p>As trees shoot upwards that are pruned below;</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Or as old Thames, borne down with decent pride,                </p>
<p>Sees his young streams run warbling at his side;</p>
<p>Though some, by art cut off, no longer run,</p>
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</a>
<p>And some are lost beneath the summer's <span class="locked">sun&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yet the pure stream moves on, and, as it moves,</p>
<p>Its power increases and its use improves;</p>
<p>While plenty round its spacious waves bestow,</p>
<p>Still it flows on, and shall for ever flow.</p>

<p>Some apology is due for the insertion of a circumstance by no means
common: that it has been a subject for complaint in any place is a
sufficient reason for its being reckoned among the evils which may happen
to the poor, and which must happen to them exclusively; nevertheless, it
is just to remark, that such neglect is very rare in any part of the kingdom,

<p>Lord Robert Manners, the youngest son of the Marquis of Granby
and the Lady Frances Seymour, daughter of Charles Duke of Somerset,
was born the 5th of February, 1758; and was placed with his brother,
the late Duke of Rutland, at Eton school, where he acquired, and ever
after retained, a considerable knowledge of the classical authors.</p>

<p>Lord Robert, after going through the duties of his profession on board
different ships, was made captain of the Resolution, and commanded her in
nine different actions, besides the last memorable one on the 2nd of April,
1782, when, in breaking the French line of battle, he received the wounds
which terminated his life, in the twenty-fourth year of his age.&mdash;<i>See the

</p>

<p class="tip2"><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p class="tip2">My obligations to your Lordship, great as they are,
have not induced me to prefix your name to the following
Poem; nor is it your Lordship's station, exalted as that is,
which prevailed upon me to solicit the honour of your protection
for it. But, when I considered your Lordship's great abilities
and good taste, so well known and so universally acknowledged,
I became anxious for the privilege with which you have indulged

to disregard a performance, marked, in any degree, with your
Lordship's approbation.</p>

<p>It is, my Lord, the province of superior rank, in general, to
bestow this kind of patronage; but superior talents only can
render it valuable. Of the value of your Lordship's I am fully
sensible; and, while I make my acknowledgments for that, and
for many other favours, I cannot suppress the pride I have in
thus publishing my gratitude, and declaring how much I have
the honour to be,</p>

<p class="tipr50 smcap">My Lord,</p>
<p class="tipr40">Your Lordship's most obedient<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</a></p>

<h4>TO THE READER.</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="uc">The</span> Poem which I now offer to the Public, is, I believe,
the only one written on the subject; at least, it is the
only one which I have any knowledge of; and, fearing there
may not be found in it many things to engage the Reader's
attention, I am willing to take the strongest hold I can upon
him, by offering something which has the claim of novelty.</p>

<p>When the subject first occurred to me, I meant, in a few
lines only, to give some description of that variety of dissociating
articles which are huddled together in our Daily Papers. As
the thought dwelt upon me, I conceived this might be done
methodically, and with some connection of parts, by taking a
larger scope; which notwithstanding I have done, I must still
apologize for a want of union and coherence in my Poem.
Subjects like this will not easily admit of them: we cannot
slide from theme to theme in an easy and graceful succession;
but, on quitting one thought, there will be an unavoidable
hiatus, and in general an awkward transition into that which
follows.</p>

<p>That, in writing upon the subject of our Newspapers, I
have avoided every thing which might appear like<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</a> the opinion
of a party, is to be accounted for from the knowledge I have
gained from them; since, the more of these Instructors a man
reads, the less he will infallibly understand; nor would it have
been very consistent in me, at the same time to censure their
temerity and ignorance, and to adopt their rage.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to have made some discrimination
in my remarks on these productions. There is, indeed, some
difference; and I have observed, that one editor will sometimes
convey his abuse with more decency, and colour his falsehood
with more appearance of probability, than another: but till I
see that paper, wherein no great character is wantonly abused,
nor groundless insinuation wilfully disseminated, I shall not
make any distinction in my remarks upon them.</p>

<p>It must, however, be confessed, that these things have their
use, and are, besides, vehicles of much amusement; but th<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</a>is
does not outweigh the evil they do to society, and the irreparable
injury they bring upon the characters of individuals. In the
following Work I have given those good properties their due
weight: they have changed indignation into mirth, and turned,
what would otherwise have been abhorrence, into derision.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">A time like this, a busy, bustling time,</p>
<p>Suits ill with writers, very ill with rhyme:</p>
<p>Unheard we sing, when party-rage runs strong,</p>
<p>And mightier madness checks the flowing song:</p>
<p>Or, should we force the peaceful Muse to wield</p>
<p>Her feeble arms amid the furious field,</p>
<p>Where party-pens a wordy war maintain,</p>
<p>Poor is her anger, and her friendship vain;</p>
<p>And oft the foes who feel her sting, combine,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Till serious vengeance pays an idle line;                       </p>
<p>For party-poets are like wasps, who dart</p>
<p>Death to themselves, and to their foes but smart.</p>
<p class="i1">Hard then our fate: if general themes we choose,</p>
<p>Neglect awaits the song, and chills the Muse;</p>
<p>Or, should we sing the subject of the day,</p>
<p>To-morrow's wonder puffs our praise away.</p>
<p>More bless'd the bards of that poetic time,</p>
<p>When all found readers who could find a rhyme;</p>
<p>Green grew the bays on every teeming head,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>And Cibber was enthroned, and Settle read.                      </p>
<p>Sing, drooping Muse, the cause of thy decline;</p>
<p>Why reign no more the once-triumphant Nine?</p>
<p>Alas! new charms the wavering many gain,</p>
<p>And rival sheets the reader's eye detain;</p>
<p>A daily swarm, that banish every Muse,</p>
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</a>
<p>Come flying forth, and mortals call them <span class="smcap">News</span>:</p>
<p>For these unread the noblest volumes lie;</p>
<p>For these in sheets unsoil'd the Muses die;</p>
<p>Unbought, unbless'd, the virgin copies wait</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>In vain for fame, and sink, unseen, to fate.                    </p>
<p class="i1">Since, then, the town forsakes us for our foes,</p>
<p>The smoothest numbers for the harshest prose;</p>
<p>Let us, with generous scorn, the taste deride,</p>
<p>And sing our rivals with a rival's pride.</p>
<p class="i1">Ye gentle poets, who so oft complain</p>
<p>That foul neglect is all your labours gain;</p>
<p>That pity only checks your growing spite</p>
<p>To erring man, and prompts you still to write;</p>
<p>That your choice works on humble stalls are laid,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Or vainly grace the windows of the trade;                       </p>
<p>Be ye my friends, if friendship e'er can warm</p>
<p>Those rival bosoms whom the Muses charm:</p>
<p>Think of the common cause wherein we go,</p>
<p>Like gallant Greeks against the Trojan foe;</p>
<p>Nor let one peevish chief his leader blame,</p>
<p>Till, crown'd with conquest, we regain our fame;</p>
<p>And let us join our forces to subdue</p>
<p>This bold assuming but successful crew.</p>

<p>Whate'er their name, whate'er the time they fly,</p>
<p>Damp from the press, to charm the reader's eye:</p>
<p>For, soon as morning dawns with roseate hue,</p>
<p>The Herald of the morn arises too;</p>
<p>Post after Post succeeds, and, all day long,</p>
<p>Gazettes and Ledgers swarm, a noisy throng.</p>
<p>When evening comes, she comes with all her train</p>
<p>Of Ledgers, Chronicles, and Posts <span class="locked">again&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Of all these triflers, all like these, I write;</p>
<p>Oh! like my subject could my song delight,</p>
<p>The crowd at Lloyd's one poet's name should raise,</p>
<p>And all the Alley echo to his praise.</p>

<p class="i1">In shoals the hours their constant numbers bring,</p>
<p>Like insects waking to th' advancing spring;</p>
<p>Which take their rise from grubs obscene that lie</p>
<p>In shallow pools, or thence ascend the sky:</p>
<p>Such are these base ephemeras, so born</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>To die before the next revolving morn.                          </p>
<p class="i1">Yet thus they differ: insect-tribes are lost</p>
<p>In the first visit of a winter's frost;</p>
<p>While these remain, a base but constant breed,</p>
<p>Whose swarming sons their short-lived sires succeed:</p>
<p>No changing season makes their number less,</p>
<p>Nor Sunday shines a sabbath on the press!</p>
<p class="i1">Then, lo! the sainted Monitor is born,</p>
<p>Whose pious face some sacred texts adorn:</p>
<p>As artful sinners cloak the secret sin,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>To veil with seeming grace the guile within;                    </p>
<p>So Moral Essays on his front appear,</p>
<p>But all is carnal business in the rear;</p>
<p>The fresh-coin'd lie, the secret whisper'd last,</p>
<p>And all the gleanings of the six days past.</p>
<p class="i1">With these retired, through half the Sabbath-day,</p>
<p>The London-lounger yawns his hours away:</p>
<p>Not so, my little flock! your preacher fly,</p>
<p>Nor waste the time no worldly wealth can buy;</p>
<p>But let the decent maid and sober clown</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Pray for these idlers of the sinful town:                       </p>
<p>This day, at least, on nobler themes bestow,</p>
<p>Nor give to Woodfall, or the world below.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">But, Sunday pass'd, what numbers flourish then,</p>
<p>What wond'rous labours of the press and pen!</p>

<p>When thousand starving minds such manna seek<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,</p>

<p>Like idle flies, a busy, buzzing train,</p>
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</a>
<p>They drop their maggots in the trifler's brain;</p>
<p>That genial soil receives the fruitful store,</p>

<p>Disjointed scraps of fate involved in doubt;</p>
<p>So idle dreams, the journals of the night,</p>

<p>Some champions for the rights that prop the crown,</p>
<p>Some sturdy patriots, sworn to pull them down;</p>
<p>Some neutral powers, with secret forces fraught,</p>
<p>Wishing for war, but willing to be bought:</p>
<p>While some to every side and party go,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Shift every friend, and join with every foe;                   </p>
<p>Like sturdy rogues in privateers, they strike</p>
<p>This side and that, the foes of both alike;</p>
<p>A traitor-crew, who thrive in troubled times,</p>
<p>Fear'd for their force, and courted for their crimes.</p>
<p class="i1">Chief to the prosperous side the numbers sail,</p>

<p>Some bold adventurers first prepare to try</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>The doubtful sunshine of the distant sky;                      </p>
<p>But soon the growing Summer's certain sun</p>
<p>Wins more and more, till all at last are won:</p>
<p>So, on the early prospect of disgrace,</p>

<p>Safe from all want, and sound in every limb;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Yes! there was he, and there was care with him.                </p>
<p class="i1">Unbound and heap'd, these valued works beside,</p>
<p>Lay humbler works the pedler's pack supplied;</p>
<p>Yet these, long since, have all acquired a name:</p>
<p>The Wandering Jew has found his way to fame;</p>
<p>And fame, denied to many a labour'd song,</p>
<p>Crowns Thumb the great, and Hickerthrift the strong.</p>
<p class="i1">There too is he, by wizard-power upheld,</p>
<p>Jack, by whose arm the giant-brood were quell'd:</p>
<p>His shoes of swiftness on his feet he placed;</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>His coat of darkness on his loins he braced;                   </p>
<p>His sword of sharpness in his hand he took,</p>
<p>And off the heads of doughty giants stroke:</p>
<p>Their glaring eyes beheld no mortal near;</p>
<p>No sound of feet alarm'd the drowsy ear;</p>
<p>No English blood their pagan sense could smell,</p>
<p>But heads dropp'd headlong, wondering why they fell.</p>
<p class="i1">These are the peasant's joy, when, placed at ease,</p>
<p>Half his delighted offspring mount his knees.</p>
<p class="i1">To every cot the lord's indulgent mind</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Has a small space for garden-ground assign'd;                  </p>
<p>Here&mdash;till return of morn dismiss'd the <span class="locked">farm&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The careful peasant plies the sinewy arm,</p>
<p>Warm'd as he works, and casts his look around</p>
<p>On every foot of that improving ground:</p>
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</a>
<p>It is his own he sees; his master's eye</p>
<p>Peers not about, some secret fault to spy;</p>
<p>Nor voice severe is there, nor censure <span class="locked">known;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Hope, profit, pleasure,&mdash;they are all his own.</p>
<p class="i1">Here grow the humble [chives], and, hard by them,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>The leek with crown globose and reedy stem;                    </p>
<p>High climb his pulse in many an even row,</p>
<p>Deep strike the ponderous roots in soil below;</p>
<p>And herbs of potent smell and pungent taste</p>
<p>Give a warm relish to the night's repast;</p>
<p>Apples and cherries grafted by his hand,</p>
<p>And cluster'd nuts for neighbouring market stand.</p>
<p class="i1">Nor thus concludes his labour: near the cot,</p>
<p>The reed-fence rises round some fav'rite spot;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Where rich carnations, pinks with purple eyes,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Proud hyacinths, the least some florist's prize,               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Tulips tall-stemm'd and pounced auriculas rise.                </p>
<p class="i1">Here on a Sunday-eve, when service ends,</p>
<p>Meet and rejoice a family of friends;</p>
<p>All speak aloud, are happy and are free,</p>
<p>And glad they seem, and gaily they agree.</p>
<p class="i1">What, though fastidious ears may shun the speech,</p>
<p>Where all are talkers and where none can teach;</p>
<p>Where still the welcome and the words are old,</p>
<p>And the same stories are for ever <span class="locked">told&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Yet theirs is joy that, bursting from the heart,               </p>
<p>Prompts the glad tongue these nothings to impart;</p>
<p>That forms these tones of gladness we despise,</p>
<p>That lifts their steps, that sparkles in their eyes;</p>
<p>That talks or laughs or runs or shouts or plays,</p>
<p>And speaks in all their looks and all their ways.</p>
<p class="i1">Fair scenes of peace! ye might detain us long;</p>
<p>But vice and misery now demand the song,</p>
<p>And turn our view from dwellings simply neat,</p>
<p>To this infected row we term our street.</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p class="i1">Here, in cabal, a disputatious crew           </p>
<p>Each evening meet: the sot, the cheat, the shrew;</p>
<p>Riots are nightly heard&mdash;the curse, the cries</p>
<p>Of beaten wife, perverse in her replies;</p>
<p>While shrieking children hold each threat'ning hand,</p>
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</a>
<p>And sometimes life, and sometimes food, demand:</p>
<p>Boys, in their first-stol'n rags, to swear begin,</p>
<p>And girls, who heed not dress, are skill'd in gin:</p>
<p>Snarers and smugglers here their gains divide;</p>
<p>Ensnaring females here their victims hide;</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>And here is one, the sibyl of the row,                         </p>
<p>Who knows all secrets, or affects to know.</p>
<p>Seeking their fate, to her the simple run,</p>
<p>To her the guilty, theirs awhile to shun;</p>
<p>Mistress of worthless arts, depraved in will,</p>
<p>Her care unbless'd and unrepaid her skill,</p>
<p>Slave to the tribe, to whose command she stoops,</p>
<p>And poorer than the poorest maid she dupes.</p>
<p class="i1">Between the road-way and the walls, offence</p>
<p>Invades all eyes and strikes on every sense:</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>There lie, obscene, at every open door,                        </p>
<p>Heaps from the hearth and sweepings from the floor;</p>
<p>And day by day the mingled masses grow,</p>
<p>As sinks are disembogued and kennels flow.</p>
<p class="i1">There hungry dogs from hungry children steal;</p>
<p>There pigs and chickens quarrel for a meal;</p>
<p>There dropsied infants wail without redress,</p>
<p>And all is want and wo and wretchedness:</p>
<p>Yet, should these boys, with bodies bronzed and bare,</p>
<p>High-swoln and hard, outlive that lack of care,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Forced on some farm, the unexerted strength,                   </p>
<p>Though loth to action, is compell'd at length,</p>
<p>When warm'd by health, as serpents in the spring</p>
<p>Aside their slough of indolence they fling.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, ere they go, a greater evil <span class="locked">comes&mdash;</span></p>
<p>See! crowded beds in those contiguous rooms;</p>
<p>Beds but ill parted by a paltry screen</p>
<p>Of paper'd lath or curtain dropp'd between;</p>
<p>Daughters and sons to yon compartments creep,</p>
<p>And parents here beside their children sleep.</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Ye who have power, these thoughtless people part,              </p>
<p>Nor let the ear be first to taint the heart!</p>
<p class="i1">Come! search within, nor sight nor smell regard;</p>
<p>The true physician walks the foulest ward.</p>
<p>See! on the floor what frouzy patches rest!</p>
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</a>
<p>What nauseous fragments on yon fractured chest!</p>
<p>What downy dust beneath yon window-seat!</p>
<p>And round these posts that serve this bed for feet;</p>
<p>This bed, where all those tatter'd garments lie,</p>
<p>Worn by each sex, and now perforce thrown by!</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p class="i1">See! as we gaze, an infant lifts its head,        </p>
<p>Left by neglect and burrow'd in that bed;</p>
<p>The mother-gossip has the love suppress'd</p>
<p>An infant's cry once waken'd in her breast;</p>
<p>And daily prattles, as her round she takes,</p>
<p>(With strong resentment) of the want she makes.</p>
<p class="i1">Whence all these woes?&mdash;From want of virtuous will,</p>
<p>Of honest shame, of time-improving skill;</p>
<p>From want of care t'employ the vacant hour,</p>
<p>And want of ev'ry kind but want of power.</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p class="i1">Here are no wheels for either wool or flax,       </p>

<p>Here are no books, but ballads on the wall</p>
<p>Are some abusive, and indecent all;</p>
<p>Pistols are here, unpair'd; with nets and hooks,</p>
<p>Of every kind, for rivers, ponds, and brooks;</p>
<p>An ample flask, that nightly rovers fill</p>
<p>With recent poison from the Dutchman's still;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>

<p class="i1">To every house belongs a space of ground,</p>
<p>Of equal size, once fenced with paling round;</p>
<p>That paling now by slothful waste destroy'd,</p>
<p>Dead gorse and stumps of elder fill the void,</p>
<p>Save in the centre-spot, whose walls of clay</p>
<p>Hide sots and striplings at their drink or play.</p>
<p>Within, a board, beneath a tiled retreat,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Allures the bubble and maintains the cheat;                    </p>
<p>Where heavy ale in spots like varnish shows;</p>
<p>Where chalky tallies yet remain in rows;</p>
<p>Black pipes and broken jugs the seats defile,</p>
<p>The walls and windows, rhymes and reck'nings vile;</p>
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</a>
<p>Prints of the meanest kind disgrace the door,</p>
<p>And cards, in curses torn, lie fragments on the floor.</p>
<p class="i1">Here his poor bird th'inhuman cocker brings,</p>
<p>Arms his hard heel and clips his golden wings;</p>
<p>With spicy food th'impatient spirit feeds,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>And shouts and curses as the battle bleeds.                    </p>
<p>Struck through the brain, deprived of both his eyes,</p>
<p>The vanquish'd bird must combat till he dies;</p>
<p>Must faintly peck at his victorious foe,</p>
<p>And reel and stagger at each feeble blow.</p>
<p>When fall'n, the savage grasps his dabbled plumes,</p>
<p>His blood-stain'd arms, for other deaths assumes;</p>
<p>And damns the craven-fowl, that lost his stake,</p>
<p>And only bled and perish'd for his sake.</p>
<p class="i1">Such are our peasants, those to whom we yield</p>

<p>Praise with relief, the fathers of the field;                  </p>
<p>And these who take, from our reluctant hands,</p>
<p>What Burn advises or the Bench commands.</p>
<p class="i1">Our farmers round, well pleased with constant gain,</p>
<p>Like other farmers, flourish and <span class="locked">complain.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>These are our groups; our portraits next appear,</p>

</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p>With evil omen we that year begin:</p>
<p>A Child of Shame&mdash;stern Justice adds, of <span class="locked">Sin&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Is first recorded; I would hide the deed,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>But vain the wish; I sigh and I proceed:                       </p>
<p>And could I well th' instructive truth convey,</p>
<p>'Twould warn the giddy and awake the gay.</p>
<p class="i1">Of all the nymphs who gave our village grace,</p>
<p>The Miller's daughter had the fairest face.</p>
<p>Proud was the Miller; money was his pride;</p>
<p>He rode to market, as our farmers ride;</p>
<p>And 'twas his boast, inspired by spirits, there,</p>
<p>His favourite Lucy should be rich as fair;</p>
<p>But she must meek and still obedient prove,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>And not presume, without his leave, to love.                   </p>
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</a>
<p class="i1">A youthful Sailor heard him;&mdash;"Ha!" quoth he,</p>
<p>"This Miller's maiden is a prize for me;</p>
<p>Her charms I love, his riches I desire,</p>
<p>And all his threats but fan the kindling fire;</p>
<p>My ebbing purse no more the foe shall fill,</p>
<p>But Love's kind act and Lucy at the mill."</p>
<p class="i1">Thus thought the youth, and soon the chase began,</p>
<p>Stretch'd all his sail, nor thought of pause or plan:</p>
<p>His trusty staff in his bold hand he took,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Like him and like his frigate, heart of oak;                   </p>
<p>Fresh were his features, his attire was new;</p>
<p>Clean was his linen, and his jacket blue:</p>
<p>Of finest jean, his trowsers, tight and trim,</p>
<p>Brush'd the large buckle at the silver rim.</p>
<p class="i1">He soon arrived, he traced the village-green;</p>
<p>There saw the maid, and was with pleasure seen;</p>
<p>Then talk'd of love, till Lucy's yielding heart</p>
<p>Confess'd 'twas painful, though 'twas right, to part.</p>
<p class="i1">"For ah! my father has a haughty soul;</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>Whom best he loves, he loves but to control;                   </p>
<p>Me to some churl in bargain he'll consign,</p>
<p>And make some tyrant of the parish mine:</p>
<p>Cold is his heart, and he with looks severe</p>
<p>Has often forced but never shed the tear;</p>
<p>Save, when my mother died, some drops express'd</p>
<p>A kind of sorrow for a wife at <span class="locked">rest.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>To me a master's stern regard is shown,</p>
<p>I'm like his steed, prized highly as his own;</p>
<p>Stroked but corrected, threaten'd when supplied,</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>His slave and boast, his victim and his pride."                </p>
<p class="i1">"Cheer up, my lass! I'll to thy father <span class="locked">go&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The Miller cannot be the Sailor's foe;</p>
<p>Both live by Heaven's free gale, that plays aloud</p>
<p>In the stretch'd canvas and the piping shroud;</p>
<p>The rush of winds, the flapping sails above,</p>
<p>And rattling planks within, are sounds <i>we</i> love;</p>
<p>Calms are our dread; when tempests plough the deep,</p>
<p>We take a reef, and to the rocking sleep."</p>
<p class="i1">"Ha!" quoth the Miller, moved at speech so rash,</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>"Art thou like me? then, where thy notes and cash?             </p>
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</a>
<p>Away to Wapping, and a wife command,</p>
<p>With all thy wealth, a guinea, in thine hand;</p>
<p>There with thy messmates quaff the muddy cheer,</p>
<p>And leave my Lucy for thy betters here."</p>
<p class="i1">"Revenge! revenge!" the angry lover cried,</p>
<p>Then sought the nymph, and "Be thou now my bride."</p>
<p>Bride had she been, but they no priest could move</p>
<p>To bind in law the couple bound by love.</p>
<p class="i1">What sought these lovers then by day, by night,</p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>But stolen moments of disturb'd delight&mdash;                      </p>
<p>Soft trembling tumults, terrors dearly prized,</p>
<p>Transports that pain'd, and joys that agonized:</p>
<p>Till the fond damsel, pleased with lad so trim,</p>
<p>Awed by her parent, and enticed by him,</p>
<p>Her lovely form from savage power to save,</p>
<p>Gave&mdash;not her hand, but <span class="smcap">ALL</span> she could, she gave.</p>
<p class="i1">Then came the day of shame, the grievous night,</p>
<p>The varying look, the wandering appetite;</p>
<p>The joy assumed, while sorrow dimm'd the eyes;</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>The forced sad smiles that follow'd sudden sighs;              </p>
<p>And every art, long used, but used in vain,</p>
<p>To hide thy progress, Nature, and thy pain.</p>
<p class="i1">Too eager caution shows some danger's near,</p>
<p>The bully's bluster proves the coward's fear;</p>
<p>His sober step the drunkard vainly tries,</p>
<p>And nymphs expose the failings they disguise.</p>
<p class="i1">First, whispering gossips were in parties seen;</p>
<p>Then louder Scandal walk'd the village-green;</p>
<p>Next babbling Folly told the growing ill,</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>And busy Malice dropp'd it at the mill.                        </p>
<p class="i1">"Go! to thy curse and mine," the Father said,</p>
<p>"Strife and confusion stalk around thy bed;</p>
<p>Want and a wailing brat thy portion be,</p>
<p>Plague to thy fondness, as thy fault to <span class="locked">me.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Where skulks the villain?"&mdash;"On the ocean wide</p>
<p>My William seeks a portion for his <span class="locked">bride."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Vain be his search! but, till the traitor come,</p>
<p>The higgler's cottage be thy future home;</p>
<p>There with his ancient shrew and care abide,</p>
<div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>And hide thy head&mdash;thy shame thou canst not hide."             </p>
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</a>
<p class="i1">Day after day was pass'd in pains and grief;</p>
<p>Week follow'd week&mdash;and still was no relief.</p>
<p>Her boy was born&mdash;no lads nor lasses came</p>
<p>To grace the rite or give the child a name;</p>
<p>Nor grave conceited nurse, of office proud,</p>
<p>Bore the young Christian roaring through the crowd:</p>
<p>In a small chamber was my office done,</p>
<p>Where blinks through paper'd panes the setting sun;</p>
<p>Where noisy sparrows, perch'd on penthouse near,</p>
<div class="linenum">380</div>
<p>Chirp tuneless joy, and mock the frequent tear;                </p>
<p>Bats on their webby wings in darkness move,</p>
<p>And feebly shriek their melancholy love.</p>
<p class="i1">No Sailor came; the months in terror fled!</p>
<p>Then news arrived: he fought, and he was <span class="smcap">DEAD</span>!</p>
<p class="i1">At the lone cottage Lucy lives, and still</p>
<p>Walks for her weekly pittance to the mill;</p>
<p>A mean seraglio there her father keeps,</p>
<p>Whose mirth insults her, as she stands and weeps,</p>
<p>And sees the plenty, while compell'd to stay,</p>
<div class="linenum">390</div>
<p>Her father's pride become his harlot's prey.                   </p>
<p class="i1">Throughout the lanes she glides, at evening's close,</p>
<p>And softly lulls her infant to repose;</p>
<p>Then sits and gazes, but with viewless look,</p>
<p>As gilds the moon the rippling of the brook;</p>
<p>And sings her vespers, but in voice so low,</p>
<p>She hears their murmurs as the waters flow:</p>
<p>And she too murmurs, and begins to find</p>
<p>The solemn wanderings of a wounded mind.</p>
<p>Visions of terror, views of wo succeed,</p>
<div class="linenum">400</div>
<p>The mind's impatience, to the body's need;                     </p>
<p>By turns to that, by turns to this, a prey,</p>
<p>She knows what reason yields, and dreads what madness may.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Next, with their boy, a decent couple came,</p>
<p>And call'd him Robert, 'twas his father's name;</p>
<p>Three girls preceded, all by time endear'd,</p>
<p>And future births were neither hoped nor fear'd.</p>
<p>Bless'd in each other, but to no excess,</p>
<p>Health, quiet, comfort, form'd their happiness;</p>
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</a>
<p>Love, all made up of torture and delight,</p>
<div class="linenum">410</div>
<p>Was but mere madness in this couple's sight:                   </p>
<p>Susan could think, though not without a sigh,</p>
<p>If she were gone, who should her place supply;</p>
<p>And Robert, half in earnest, half in jest,</p>
<p>Talk of her spouse when he should be at rest:</p>
<p>Yet strange would either think it to be told,</p>
<p>Their love was cooling or their hearts were cold.</p>
<p>Few were their acres,&mdash;but, with these content,</p>
<p>They were, each pay-day, ready with their rent;</p>
<p>And few their wishes&mdash;what their farm denied,</p>
<div class="linenum">420</div>
<p>The neighbouring town, at trifling cost, supplied.             </p>
<p>If at the draper's window Susan cast</p>
<p>A longing look, as with her goods she pass'd,</p>
<p>And, with the produce of the wheel and churn,</p>
<p>Bought her a Sunday-robe on her return;</p>
<p>True to her maxim, she would take no rest,</p>
<p>Till care repaid that portion to the chest:</p>
<p>Or if, when loitering at the Whitsun-fair,</p>
<p>Her Robert spent some idle shillings there;</p>
<p>Up at the barn, before the break of day,</p>
<div class="linenum">430</div>
<p>He made his labour for th'indulgence pay:                      </p>
<p>Thus both&mdash;that waste itself might work in <span class="locked">vain&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Wrought double tides, and all was well again.</p>
<p>Yet, though so prudent, there were times of joy,</p>
<p>(The day they wed, the christening of the boy,)</p>
<p>When to the wealthier farmers there was shown</p>
<p>Welcome unfeign'd, and plenty like their own;</p>
<p>For Susan served the great, and had some pride</p>
<p>Among our topmost people to preside.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet in that plenty, in that welcome free,</p>
<div class="linenum">440</div>
<p>There was the guiding nice frugality,                          </p>
<p>That, in the festal as the frugal day,</p>
<p>Has, in a different mode, a sovereign sway;</p>
<p>As tides the same attractive influence know,</p>
<p>In the least ebb and in their proudest flow:</p>
<p>The wise frugality, that does not give</p>
<p>A life to saving, but that saves to live;</p>
<p>Sparing, not pinching, mindful though not mean,</p>
<p>O'er all presiding, yet in nothing seen.</p>

<p>First, of the fact they question'd&mdash;"Was it true?"</p>
<p>The child was brought&mdash;"What then remain'd to do?</p>
<p>Was't dead or living?" This was fairly proved:</p>
<p>'Twas pinch'd, it roar'd, and every doubt removed.</p>
<p>Then by what name th' unwelcome guest to call</p>

<p>Censorious men might take it for his own:</p>
<p>They look'd about, they gravely spoke to all,</p>

<p>Sad, silent, supple, bending to the blow,</p>
<p>A slave of slaves, the lowest of the low;</p>
<p>His pliant soul gave way to all things base;</p>
<p>He knew no shame, he dreaded no disgrace.</p>
<p>It seem'd, so well his passions he suppressed,</p>
<div class="linenum">720</div>
<p>No feeling stirr'd his ever-torpid breast;                     </p>
<p>Him might the meanest pauper bruise and cheat,</p>
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</a>
<p>He was a footstool for the beggar's feet;</p>
<p>His were the legs that ran at all commands;</p>
<p>They used on all occasions Richard's hands.</p>
<p>His very soul was not his own; he stole</p>
<p>As others order'd, and without a dole;</p>
<p>In all disputes, on either part he lied,</p>
<p>And freely pledged his oath on either side;</p>
<p>In all rebellions Richard join'd the rest,</p>
<div class="linenum">730</div>
<p>In all detections Richard first confess'd.                     </p>
<p>Yet, though disgraced, he watch'd his time so well,</p>
<p>He rose in favour, when in fame he fell;</p>
<p>Base was his usage, vile his whole employ,</p>
<p>And all despised and fed the pliant boy.</p>
<p>At length, "'tis time he should abroad be sent,"</p>
<p>Was whisper'd near him&mdash;and abroad he went.</p>
<p>One morn they call'd him, Richard answered not;</p>
<p>They deem'd him hanging, and in time forgot;</p>
<p>Yet miss'd him long, as each, throughout the clan,</p>
<div class="linenum">740</div>
<p>Found he "had better spared a better man."                     </p>
<p class="i1">Now Richard's talents for the world were fit,</p>
<p>He'd no small cunning, and had some small wit;</p>
<p>Had that calm look which seem'd to all assent,</p>
<p>And that complacent speech which nothing meant;</p>
<p>He'd but one care, and that he strove to hide,</p>
<p>How best for Richard Monday to provide.</p>

<p class="i1">Long lost to us, at last our man we <span class="locked">trace&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Sir Richard Monday died at Monday-place.</p>
<p>His lady's worth, his daughter's, we peruse,</p>

<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</a>
<p>But, to his native place severely just,</p>
<p>He left a pittance bound in rigid <span class="locked">trust&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Two paltry pounds, on every quarter's-day,</p>
<p>(At church produced) for forty loaves should pay:</p>
<p>A stinted gift, that to the parish shows</p>

<p>There for their wit he serves a constant <span class="locked">theme&mdash;</span></p>
<p>They praise his dairy, they extol his team,</p>
<p>They ask the price of each unrivall'd steed.</p>

<p class="i1">"Disposed to wed, e'en while you hasten, stay;</p>
<p>There's great advantage in a small <span class="locked">delay:"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Thus Ovid sang, and much the wise approve</p>
<p>This prudent maxim of the priest of Love.</p>
<p>If poor, delay for future want prepares,</p>
<p>And eases humble life of half its cares;</p>
<p>If rich, delay shall brace the thoughtful mind,</p>
<p>T' endure the ills that e'en the happiest find:</p>
<p>Delay shall knowledge yield on either part,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>And show the value of the vanquished heart;                     </p>
<p>The humours, passions, merits, failings prove,</p>
<p>And gently raise the veil that's worn by Love;</p>
<p>Love, that impatient guide&mdash;too proud to think</p>
<p>Of vulgar wants, of clothing, meat and <span class="locked">drink&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Urges our amorous swains their joys to seize,</p>
<p>And then, at rags and hunger frighten'd, <span class="locked">flees.&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Thy sense of matrimonial happiness,</p>
<p>Till every youth, whose bans at church were read,</p>
<p>Strove not to meet, or meeting, hung his head;</p>

<p class="i1">Fie! Nathan! fie! to let an artful jade</p>
<p>The close recesses of thine heart invade;</p>
<p>What grievous pangs, what suffering, she'll impart,</p>
<p>And fill with anguish that rebellious heart;</p>
<p>For thou wilt strive incessantly, in vain,</p>
<p>By threatening speech, thy freedom to regain:</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>But she for conquest married, nor will prove                    </p>
<p>A dupe to thee, thine anger, or thy love.</p>
<p>Clamorous her tongue will be;&mdash;of either sex,</p>

<p>In the vain ramblings of a vulgar taste;</p>
<p>And will be happy to exert her power,</p>
<p>In every eye, in thine, at every hour.</p>
<p class="i1">Then wilt thou bluster&mdash;"No! I will not rest,</p>

<p class="i1">Thus, with example sad, our year began,</p>
<p>A wanton vixen and a weary man;</p>

<p>Young let the lover be, the lady old,</p>

<p>No bane of peace, although some bar to love:</p>

<p>Young wives, like changing winds, their power display,</p>

<p>By shifting points and varying day by day;                      </p>
<p>Now zephyrs mild, now whirlwinds in their force,</p>
<p>They sometimes speed, but often thwart our course;</p>
<p>And much experienced should that pilot be,</p>
<p>Who sails with them on life's tempestuous sea.</p>
<p>But like a trade-wind is the ancient dame,</p>
<p>Mild to your wish, and every day the same;</p>
<p>Steady as time, no sudden squalls you fear,</p>
<p>But set full sail and with assurance steer;</p>
<p>Till every danger in your way be pass'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>And then she gently, mildly breathes her last;                  </p>
<p>Rich you arrive, in port awhile remain,</p>
<p>And for a second venture sail again.</p>

<p class="i1">For this, blithe Donald southward made his way,</p>
<p>And left the lasses on the banks of Tay;</p>
<p>Him to a neighbouring garden fortune sent,</p>
<p>Whom we beheld, aspiringly content:</p>
<p>Patient and mild, he sought the dame to please,</p>
<p>Who ruled the kitchen and who bore the keys.</p>
<p>Fair Lucy first, the laundry's grace and pride,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>With smiles and gracious looks, her fortune tried;              </p>
<p>But all in vain she praised his "pawky eyne,"</p>
<p>Where never fondness was for Lucy seen:</p>
<p>Him the mild Susan, boast of dairies, loved,</p>
<p>And found him civil, cautious, and unmoved:</p>
<p>From many a fragrant simple, Catharine's skill</p>
<p>Drew oil and essence from the boiling still;</p>
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</a>
<p>But not her warmth, nor all her winning ways,</p>
<p>From his cool phlegm could Donald's spirit raise:</p>
<p>Of beauty heedless, with the merry mute,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>To Mistress Dobson he preferr'd his suit;                      </p>
<p>There proved his service, there address'd his vows,</p>
<p>And saw her mistress&mdash;friend&mdash;protectress&mdash;spouse;</p>
<p>A butler now, he thanks his powerful bride,</p>
<p>And, like her keys, keeps constant at her side.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Next at our altar stood a luckless pair,</p>
<p>Brought by strong passions and a warrant there;</p>
<p>By long rent cloak, hung loosely, strove the bride,</p>
<p>From ev'ry eye what all perceived to hide;</p>
<p>While the boy-bridegroom, shuffling in his pace,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Now hid awhile and then exposed his face;                      </p>
<p>As shame alternately with anger strove</p>
<p>The brain confused with muddy ale to move.</p>
<p>In haste and stammering he perform'd his part,</p>
<p>And look'd the rage that rankled in his heart;</p>
<p>(So will each lover inly curse his fate,</p>
<p>Too soon made happy and made wise too late;)</p>
<p>I saw his features take a savage gloom,</p>
<p>And deeply threaten for the days to come.</p>
<p>Low spake the lass, and lisp'd and minced the while,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Look'd on the lad, and faintly tried to smile;                 </p>
<p>With soften'd speech and humbled tone she strove</p>
<p>To stir the embers of departed love:</p>
<p>While he, a tyrant, frowning walk'd before,</p>
<p>Felt the poor purse and sought the public door,</p>
<p>She, sadly following, in submission went,</p>
<p>And saw the final shilling foully spent;</p>
<p>Then to her father's hut the pair withdrew,</p>
<p>And bade to love and comfort long adieu!</p>
<p class="i1">Ah! fly temptation, youth, refrain! refrain!</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Two summers since, I saw, at Lammas Fair,</p>
<p>The sweetest flower that ever blossom'd there,</p>
<p>When Ph&oelig;be Dawson gaily cross'd the Green,</p>
<p>In haste to see and happy to be seen:</p>
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</a>
<p>Her air, her manners, all who saw admired,</p>
<p>Courteous though coy, and gentle though retired;</p>
<p>The joy of youth and health her eyes display'd,</p>
<p>And ease of heart her every look convey'd;</p>
<p>A native skill her simple robes express'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>As with untutor'd elegance she dress'd;                        </p>
<p>The lads around admired so fair a sight,</p>
<p>And Ph&oelig;be felt, and felt she gave, delight.</p>
<p>Admirers soon of every age she gain'd,</p>
<p>Her beauty won them and her worth retain'd;</p>
<p>Envy itself could no contempt display,</p>
<p>They wish'd her well, whom yet they wish'd away.</p>
<p>Correct in thought, she judged a servant's place</p>
<p>Preserved a rustic beauty from disgrace;</p>
<p>But yet on Sunday-eve, in freedom's hour,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>With secret joy she felt that beauty's power,                  </p>
<p>When some proud bliss upon the heart would steal,</p>
<p>That, poor or rich, a beauty still must <span class="locked">feel.&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">At length, the youth, ordain'd to move her breast,</p>
<p>Before the swains with bolder spirit press'd;</p>
<p>With looks less timid made his passion known,</p>
<p>And pleased by manners most unlike her own;</p>
<p>Loud though in love, and confident though young;</p>
<p>Fierce in his air, and voluble of tongue;</p>
<p>By trade a tailor, though, in scorn of trade,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>He served the 'Squire, and brush'd the coat he made:           </p>
<p>Yet now, would Ph&oelig;be her consent afford,</p>
<p>Her slave alone, again he'd mount the board;</p>
<p>With her should years of growing love be spent,</p>
<p>And growing wealth&mdash;she sigh'd and look'd consent.</p>
<p class="i1">Now, through the lane, up hill, and 'cross the green,</p>
<p>(Seen by but few, and blushing to be <span class="locked">seen&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Dejected, thoughtful, anxious, and afraid,)</p>
<p>Led by the lover, walk'd the silent maid.</p>
<p>Slow through the meadows roved they many a mile,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Toy'd by each bank and trifled at each stile;                  </p>
<p>Where, as he painted every blissful view,</p>
<p>And highly colour'd what he strongly drew,</p>
<p>The pensive damsel, prone to tender fears,</p>
<p>Dimm'd the false prospect with prophetic <span class="locked">tears.&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</a>
<p>Thus pass'd th' allotted hours, till, lingering late,</p>
<p>The lover loiter'd at the master's gate;</p>
<p>There he pronounced adieu! and yet would stay,</p>
<p>Till chidden&mdash;soothed&mdash;entreated&mdash;forced away,</p>
<p>He would of coldness, though indulged, complain,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>And oft retire and oft return again;                           </p>
<p>When, if his teasing vex'd her gentle mind,</p>
<p>The grief assumed, compell'd her to be kind!</p>
<p>For he would proof of plighted kindness crave,</p>
<p>That she resented first and then forgave,</p>
<p>And to his grief and penance yielded more</p>
<p>Than his presumption had required <span class="locked">before.&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">Ah! fly temptation, youth; refrain! refrain,</p>
<p>Each yielding maid and each presuming swain!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Lo! now with red rent cloak and bonnet black,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And torn green gown loose hanging at her back,                 </p>
<p>One who an infant in her arms sustains,</p>
<p>And seems in patience striving with her pains;</p>
<p>Pinch'd are her looks, as one who pines for bread,</p>
<p>Whose cares are growing and whose hopes are fled;</p>
<p>Pale her parch'd lips, her heavy eyes sunk low,</p>
<p>And tears unnoticed from their channels flow;</p>
<p>Serene her manner, till some sudden pain</p>
<p>Frets the meek soul, and then she's calm <span class="locked">again.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Her broken pitcher to the pool she takes,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And every step with cautious terror makes;                     </p>
<p>For not alone that infant in her arms,</p>
<p>But nearer cause, her anxious soul alarms.</p>
<p>With water burthen'd, then she picks her way,</p>
<p>Slowly and cautious, in the clinging clay;</p>
<p>Till, in mid-green, she trusts a place unsound,</p>
<p>And deeply plunges in th' adhesive ground;</p>
<p>Thence, but with pain, her slender foot she takes,</p>
<p>While hope the mind, as strength the frame, forsakes:</p>
<p>For, when so full the cup of sorrow grows,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Add but a drop, it instantly o'erflows.                        </p>
<p>And now her path, but not her peace, she gains,</p>
<p>Safe from her task, but shivering with her pains;</p>
<p>Her home she reaches, open leaves the door,</p>
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</a>
<p>And, placing first her infant on the floor,</p>
<p>She bares her bosom to the wind, and sits,</p>
<p>And sobbing struggles with the rising fits.</p>
<p>In vain, they come; she feels th'inflating grief,</p>
<p>That shuts the swelling bosom from relief;</p>
<p>That speaks in feeble cries a soul distressed,</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Or the sad laugh that cannot be repress'd.                     </p>
<p>The neighbour-matron leaves her wheel and flies</p>
<p>With all the aid her poverty supplies;</p>
<p>Unfee'd, the calls of Nature she obeys,</p>
<p>Not led by profit, nor allured by praise;</p>
<p>And, waiting long, till these contentions cease,</p>
<p>She speaks of comfort, and departs in peace.</p>
<p class="i1">Friend of distress! the mourner feels thy aid,</p>
<p>She cannot pay thee, but thou wilt be paid.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">But who this child of weakness, want, and care?</p>

<p>Who took her lover for his sparkling eyes,</p>
<p>Expressions warm, and love-inspiring lies.</p>
<p>Compassion first assail'd her gentle heart,</p>
<p>For all his suffering, all his bosom's smart:</p>
<p>And then his prayers! they would a savage move,</p>
<p>And win the coldest of the sex to love.</p>

<p>A captious tyrant or a noisy sot:                              </p>

<p>If absent, spending what their labours gain'd;</p>

<p class="i1">Our Knight, relenting, now befriends a youth,</p>

<p>That will not perish, and that cannot <span class="locked">cloy&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A living joy, that shall its spirit keep,</p>

<p>A Captain thither, rich from India, came,                      </p>
<p>And though a cousin call'd, it touch'd her fame:</p>
<p>Her annual stipend rose from his behest,</p>
<p>And all the long-prized treasures she <span class="locked">possess'd:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>If aught like joy awhile appear'd to stay</p>
<p>In that stern face, and chase those frowns away,</p>
<p>'Twas when her treasures she disposed for view,</p>
<p>And heard the praises to their splendour due;</p>
<p>Silks beyond price, so rich, they'd stand alone,</p>
<p>And diamonds blazing on the buckled zone;</p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>Rows of rare pearls by curious workmen set,                    </p>
<p>And bracelets fair in box of glossy jet;</p>
<p>Bright polish'd amber precious from its size,</p>
<p>Or forms the fairest fancy could devise.</p>
<p>Her drawers of cedar, shut with secret springs,</p>
<p>Conceal'd the watch of gold and rubied rings;</p>
<p>Letters, long proofs of love, and verses fine</p>
<p>Round the pink'd rims of crisped Valentine.</p>
<p>Her china-closet, cause of daily care,</p>
<p>For woman's wonder held her pencill'd ware;</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>That pictured wealth of China and Japan,                       </p>
<p>Like its cold mistress, shunn'd the eye of man.</p>
<p class="i1">Her neat small room, adorn'd with maiden-taste,</p>
<p>A clipp'd French puppy, first of favourites, graced;</p>
<p>A parrot next, but dead and stuff'd with art;</p>
<p>(For Poll, when living, lost the Lady's heart,</p>
<p>And then his life; for he was heard to speak</p>
<p>Such frightful words as tinged his Lady's cheek;)</p>
<p>Unhappy bird! who had no power to prove,</p>
<p>Save by such speech, his gratitude and love.</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>A grey old cat his whiskers lick'd beside;                     </p>
<p>A type of sadness in the house of pride.</p>
<p>The polish'd surface of an India chest,</p>
<p>A glassy globe, in frame of ivory, press'd;</p>
<p>Where swam two finny creatures: one of gold,</p>
<p>Of silver one, both beauteous to behold.</p>
<p>All these were form'd the guiding taste to suit;</p>
<p>The beasts well-manner'd and the fishes mute.</p>
<p>A widow'd Aunt was there, compelled by need</p>
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</a>
<p>The nymph to flatter and her tribe to feed;</p>
<div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>Who, veiling well her scorn, endured the clog,                 </p>
<p>Mute as the fish and fawning as the dog.</p>
<p class="i1">As years increased, these treasures, her delight,</p>
<p>Arose in value in their owner's sight:</p>
<p>A miser knows that, view it as he will,</p>
<p>A guinea kept is but a guinea still;</p>
<p>And so he puts it to its proper use,</p>
<p>That something more this guinea may produce:</p>
<p>But silks and rings, in the possessor's eyes,</p>
<p>The oft'ner seen, the more in value rise,</p>
<div class="linenum">380</div>
<p>And thus are wisely hoarded to bestow                          </p>
<p>The kind of pleasure that with years will grow.</p>
<p class="i1">But what avail'd their worth&mdash;if worth had <span class="locked">they&mdash;</span></p>
<p>In the sad summer of her slow decay?</p>
<p class="i1">Then we beheld her turn an anxious look</p>
<p>From trunks and chests, and fix it on her <span class="locked">book&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A rich-bound Book of Prayer the Captain gave,</p>
<p>(Some Princess had it, or was said to have;)</p>
<p>And then once more, on all her stores, look round,</p>
<p>And draw a sigh so piteous and profound,</p>
<div class="linenum">390</div>
<p>That told, "Alas! how hard from these to part,                 </p>
<p>And for new hopes and habits form the heart!</p>
<p>What shall I do," (she cried,) "my peace of mind</p>
<p>To gain in dying, and to die resign'd?"</p>
<p class="i1">"Hear," we return'd;&mdash;"these baubles cast aside,</p>
<p>Nor give thy God a rival in thy pride;</p>
<p>Thy closets shut, and ope thy kitchen's door;</p>
<p><i>There</i> own thy failings, <i>here</i> invite the poor;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>A friend of Mammon let thy bounty make;                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>For widows' prayers thy vanities forsake;                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><div class="linenum">400</div><p>And let the hungry of thy pride partake:                       </p>
<p>Then shall thy inward eye with joy survey</p>
<p>The angel Mercy tempering Death's delay!"</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! 'twas hard; the treasures still had charms,</p>
<p>Hope still its flattery, sickness its alarms;</p>
<p>Still was the same unsettled, clouded view,</p>
<p>And the same plaintive cry, "What shall I do?"</p>
<p class="i1">Nor change appear'd: for when her race was run,</p>
<p>Doubtful we all exclaim'd, "What has been done?"</p>
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</a>
<p>Apart she lived, and still she lies alone;</p>
<div class="linenum">410</div>
<p>Yon earthy heap awaits the flattering stone,                   </p>
<p>On which invention shall be long employ'd,</p>
<p>To show the various worth of Catherine Lloyd.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Next to these ladies, but in nought allied,</p>
<p>A noble Peasant, Isaac Ashford, died.</p>
<p>Noble he was, contemning all things mean,</p>
<p>His truth unquestion'd and his soul serene;</p>
<p>Of no man's presence Isaac felt afraid;</p>
<p>At no man's question Isaac look'd dismay'd:</p>
<p>Shame knew him not, he dreaded no disgrace;</p>
<div class="linenum">420</div>
<p>Truth, simple truth, was written in his face;                  </p>
<p>Yet while the serious thought his soul approved,</p>
<p>Cheerful he seem'd, and gentleness he loved.</p>
<p>To bliss domestic he his heart resign'd,</p>
<p>And, with the firmest, had the fondest mind.</p>
<p>Were others joyful, he look'd smiling on,</p>
<p>And gave allowance where he needed none;</p>
<p>Good he refused with future ill to buy,</p>
<p>Nor knew a joy that caused reflection's sigh;</p>
<p>A friend to virtue, his unclouded breast</p>
<div class="linenum">430</div>
<p>No envy stung, no jealousy distress'd;                         </p>
<p>(Bane of the poor! it wounds their weaker mind,</p>
<p>To miss one favour which their neighbours find.)</p>
<p>Yet far was he from stoic pride removed;</p>
<p>He felt humanely, and he warmly loved.</p>
<p>I mark'd his action, when his infant died,</p>
<p>And his old neighbour for offence was tried;</p>
<p>The still tears, stealing down that furrow'd cheek,</p>
<p>Spoke pity, plainer than the tongue can speak.</p>
<p>If pride were his, 'twas not their vulgar pride,</p>
<div class="linenum">440</div>
<p>Who, in their base contempt, the great deride;                 </p>
<p>Nor pride in learning,&mdash;though my clerk agreed,</p>
<p>If fate should call him, Ashford might succeed;</p>
<p>Nor pride in rustic skill, although we knew</p>
<p>None his superior, and his equals <span class="locked">few:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But, if that spirit in his soul had place,</p>
<p>It was the jealous pride that shuns disgrace:</p>
<p>A pride in honest fame, by virtue gain'd,</p>
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</a>
<p>In sturdy boys to virtuous labours train'd;</p>
<p>Pride in the power that guards his country's coast,</p>
<div class="linenum">450</div>
<p>And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast;                       </p>
<p>Pride in a life that slander's tongue <span class="locked">defied,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>In fact, a noble passion, misnamed pride.</p>
<p class="i1">He had no party's rage, no sect'ry's whim;</p>
<p>Christian and countryman was all with him.</p>
<p>True to his church he came; no Sunday-shower</p>
<p>Kept him at home in that important hour;</p>
<p>Nor his firm feet could one persuading sect,</p>
<p>By the strong glare of their new light, <span class="locked">direct;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"On hope, in mine own sober light, I gaze,</p>
<div class="linenum">460</div>
<p>But should be blind and lose it, in your blaze."               </p>
<p class="i1">In times severe, when many a sturdy swain</p>
<p>Felt it his pride, his comfort, to complain,</p>
<p>Isaac their wants would soothe, his own would hide,</p>
<p>And feel in that his comfort and his pride.</p>
<p class="i1">At length he found, when seventy years were run,</p>
<p>His strength departed, and his labour done;</p>
<p>When he, save honest fame, retain'd no more,</p>
<p>But lost his wife and saw his children poor:</p>
<p>'Twas then, a spark of&mdash;say not, <span class="locked">discontent&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">470</div>
<p>Struck on his mind, and thus he gave it vent:                  </p>
<p class="i1">"Kind are your laws, ('tis not to be denied,)</p>
<p>That in yon house for ruin'd age provide,</p>
<p>And they are just;&mdash;when young, we give you all,</p>
<p>And for assistance in our weakness <span class="locked">call.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Why then this proud reluctance to be fed,</p>
<p>To join your poor, and eat the parish-bread?</p>
<p>But yet I linger, loth with him to feed,</p>
<p>Who gains his plenty by the sons of need;</p>
<p>He who, by contract, all your paupers took,</p>
<div class="linenum">480</div>
<p>And gauges stomachs with an anxious look.                      </p>
<p>On some old master I could well depend;</p>
<p>See him with joy and thank him as a friend;</p>
<p>But ill on him, who doles the day's supply,</p>
<p>And counts our chances, who at night may die:</p>
<p>Yet help me, Heav'n! and let me not complain</p>
<p>Of what I suffer, but my fate sustain."</p>
<p class="i1">Such were his thoughts, and so resign'd he grew;</p>
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</a>
<p>Daily he placed the workhouse in his view!</p>
<p>But came not there, for sudden was his fate:</p>
<div class="linenum">490</div>
<p>He dropp'd, expiring, at his cottage-gate.                     </p>
<p class="i1">I feel his absence in the hours of prayer,</p>
<p>And view his seat and sigh for Isaac there:</p>
<p>I see no more those white locks thinly spread</p>
<p>Round the bald polish of that honoured head;</p>
<p>No more that awful glance on playful wight,</p>
<p>Compell'd to kneel and tremble at the sight,</p>
<p>To fold his fingers, all in dread the while,</p>
<p>Till Mister Ashford soften'd to a smile;</p>
<p>No more that meek and suppliant look in prayer,</p>
<div class="linenum">500</div>
<p>Nor the pure faith (to give it force), are there;&mdash;            </p>
<p>But he is bless'd, and I lament no more</p>
<p>A wise good man, contented to be poor.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Then died a Rambler: not the one who sails</p>
<p>And trucks, for female favours, beads and nails;</p>
<p>Not one, who posts from place to place&mdash;of men</p>
<p>And manners treating with a flying pen;</p>
<p>Not he, who climbs, for prospects, Snowd[o]n's height,</p>
<p>And chides the clouds that intercept the sight;</p>
<p>No curious shell, rare plant, or brilliant spar,</p>
<div class="linenum">500</div>
<p>Enticed our traveller from his home so far;                    </p>
<p>But all the reason, by himself assign'd</p>
<p>For so much rambling, was, a restless mind;</p>
<p>As on, from place to place, without intent,</p>
<p>Without reflection, Robin Dingley went.</p>
<p class="i1">Not thus by nature;&mdash;never man was found</p>
<p>Less prone to wander from his parish-bound:</p>
<p>Claudian's old Man, to whom all scenes were new,</p>
<p>Save those where he and where his apples grew,</p>
<p>Resembled Robin, who around would look,</p>
<div class="linenum">520</div>
<p>And his horizon for the earth's mistook.                       </p>
<p class="i1">To this poor swain a keen Attorney <span class="locked">came:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"I give thee joy, good fellow! on thy name;</p>
<p>The rich old Dingley's dead;&mdash;no child has he,</p>
<p>Nor wife, nor will; his ALL is left for thee:</p>
<p>To be his fortune's heir thy claim is good;</p>
<p>Thou hast the name, and we will prove the blood."</p>
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</a>
<p class="i1">The claim was made; 'twas tried&mdash;it would not stand;</p>
<p>They proved the blood, but were refused the land.</p>
<p class="i1">Assured of wealth, this man of simple heart,</p>
<div class="linenum">530</div>
<p>To every friend had predisposed a part:                        </p>
<p>His wife had hopes indulged of various kind;</p>
<p>The three Miss Dingleys had their school assign'd,</p>
<p>Masters were sought for what they each required,</p>
<p>And books were bought and harpsichords were hired:</p>
<p>So high was hope;&mdash;the failure touch'd his brain,</p>
<p>And Robin never was himself again.</p>
<p>Yet he no wrath, no angry wish express'd,</p>
<p>But tried, in vain, to labour or to rest;</p>
<p>Then cast his bundle on his back, and went</p>
<div class="linenum">540</div>
<p>He knew not whither, nor for what intent.                      </p>
<p class="i1">Years fled;&mdash;of Robin all remembrance past,</p>
<p>When home he wander'd in his rags at last.</p>
<p>A sailor's jacket on his limbs was thrown,</p>
<p>A sailor's story he had made his own;</p>
<p>Had suffer'd battles, prisons, tempests, storms,</p>
<p>Encountering death in all his ugliest forms.</p>
<p>His cheeks were haggard, hollow was his eye,</p>
<p>Where madness lurk'd, conceal'd in misery;</p>
<p>Want, and th' ungentle world, had taught a part,</p>
<div class="linenum">550</div>
<p>And prompted cunning to that simple heart:                     </p>
<p>He now bethought him, he would roam no more,</p>
<p>But live at home and labour as before.</p>
<p class="i1">Here clothed and fed, no sooner he began</p>
<p>To round and redden, than away he ran;</p>
<p>His wife was dead, their children past his aid:</p>
<p>So, unmolested, from his home he stray'd.</p>
<p>Six years elapsed, when, worn with want and pain,</p>
<p>Came Robin, wrapt in all his rags, <span class="locked">again.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>We chide, we pity;&mdash;placed among our poor,</p>
<div class="linenum">560</div>
<p>He fed again, and was a man once more.                         </p>
<p class="i1">As when a gaunt and hungry fox is found,</p>
<p>Entrapp'd alive in some rich hunter's ground;</p>
<p>Fed for the field, although each day's a feast,</p>
<p><i>Fatten</i> you may, but never <i>tame</i> the beast;</p>
<p>A house protects him, savoury viands sustain;</p>
<p>But loose his neck and off he goes again:</p>
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</a>
<p>So stole our vagrant from his warm retreat,</p>
<p>To rove a prowler and be deem'd a cheat.</p>
<p class="i1">Hard was his fare; for, him at length we saw,</p>
<div class="linenum">570</div>
<p>In cart convey'd and laid supine on straw.                     </p>
<p>His feeble voice now spoke a sinking heart;</p>
<p>His groans now told the motions of the cart;</p>
<p>And when it stopp'd, he tried in vain to stand;</p>
<p>Closed was his eye, and clench'd his clammy hand;</p>
<p>Life ebb'd apace, and our best aid no more</p>
<p>Could his weak sense or dying heart restore:</p>
<p>But now he fell, a victim to the snare,</p>
<p>That vile attorneys for the weak <span class="locked">prepare&mdash;</span></p>
<p>They who, when profit or resentment call,</p>
<div class="linenum">580</div>
<p>Heed not the groaning victim they enthrall.                    </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Then died lamented, in the strength of life,</p>
<p>A valued Mother and a faithful Wife;</p>
<p>Call'd not away, when time had loosed each hold</p>
<p>On the fond heart, and each desire grew cold;</p>
<p>But when, to all that knit us to our kind,</p>
<p>She felt fast-bound, as charity can <span class="locked">bind&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Not, when the ills of age, its pain, its care,</p>
<p>The drooping spirit for its fate prepare;</p>
<p>And each affection, failing, leaves the heart</p>
<div class="linenum">590</div>
<p>Loosed from life's charm and willing to depart&mdash;               </p>
<p>But all her ties the strong invader broke,</p>
<p>In all their strength, by one tremendous stroke!</p>
<p>Sudden and swift the eager pest came on,</p>
<p>And terror grew, till every hope was gone;</p>
<p>Still those around appear'd for hope to seek!</p>
<p>But view'd the sick, and were afraid to <span class="locked">speak.&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">Slowly they bore, with solemn step, the dead;</p>
<p>When grief grew loud and bitter tears were shed,</p>
<p>My part began; a crowd drew near the place,</p>
<div class="linenum">600</div>
<p>Awe in each eye, alarm in every face:                          </p>
<p>So swift the ill, and of so fierce a kind,</p>
<p>That fear with pity mingled in each mind;</p>
<p>Friends with the husband came their griefs to blend;</p>
<p>For good-man Frankford was to all a friend.</p>
<p>The last-born boy they held above the bier;</p>
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</a>
<p>He knew not grief, but cries express'd his fear;</p>
<p>Each different age and sex reveal'd its pain,</p>
<p>In now a louder, now a lower strain;</p>
<p>While the meek father, listening to their tones,</p>
<div class="linenum">610</div>
<p>Swell'd the full cadence of the grief by groans.               </p>
<p class="i1">The elder sister strove her pangs to hide,</p>
<p>And soothing words to younger minds applied</p>
<p>"Be still, be patient," oft she strove to say;</p>
<p>But fail'd as oft, and weeping turn'd away.</p>
<p class="i1">Curious and sad, upon the fresh-dug hill,</p>
<p>The village-lads stood melancholy still;</p>
<p>And idle children, wandering to-and-fro,</p>
<p>As Nature guided, took the tone of wo.</p>
<p class="i1">Arrived at home, how then they gazed around,</p>
<div class="linenum">620</div>
<p>In every place&mdash;where she no more was found;                   </p>
<p>The seat at table she was wont to fill;</p>
<p>The fire-side chair, still set, but vacant still;</p>
<p>The garden-walks, a labour all her own,</p>
<p>The latticed bower, with trailing shrubs o'ergrown;</p>
<p>The Sunday-pew she fill'd with all her <span class="locked">race&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Each place of hers, was now a sacred place,</p>
<p>That, while it call'd up sorrows in the eyes,</p>
<p>Pierced the full heart and forced them still to rise.</p>
<p class="i1">Oh sacred sorrow! by whom souls are tried,</p>
<div class="linenum">630</div>
<p>Sent not to punish mortals, but to guide;                      </p>
<p>If thou art mine, (and who shall proudly dare</p>
<p>To tell his Maker, he has had his share?)</p>
<p>Still let me feel for what thy pangs are sent,</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Of Leah Cousins next the name appears,</p>
<p>With honours crown'd and bless'd with length of years,</p>
<p>Save that she lived to feel, in life's decay,</p>
<p>The pleasure die, the honours drop away.</p>
<p>A matron she, whom every village-wife</p>
<div class="linenum">640</div>
<p>View'd as the help and guardian of her life;                   </p>
<p>Fathers and sons, indebted to her aid,</p>
<p>Respect to her and her profession paid;</p>
<p>Who in the house of plenty largely fed,</p>
<p>Yet took her station at the pauper's bed;</p>
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</a>
<p>Nor from that duty could be bribed again,</p>
<p>While fear or danger urged her to remain.</p>
<p>In her experience all her friends relied;</p>
<p>Heaven was her help and nature was her guide.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus Leah lived, long trusted, much caress'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">650</div>
<p>Till a Town-Dame a youthful Farmer bless'd;                    </p>
<p>A gay vain bride, who would example give</p>
<p>To that poor village where she deign'd to live;</p>
<p>Some few months past, she sent, in hour of need,</p>
<p>For Doctor Glibb, who came with wond'rous speed:</p>
<p>Two days he waited, all his art applied,</p>
<p>To save the mother when her infant <span class="locked">died:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"'Twas well I came," at last he deign'd to say;</p>

<p class="i1">The news ran round:&mdash;"How vast the Doctor's pow'r!</p>
<div class="linenum">660</div>
<p>He saved the Lady in the trying hour;                          </p>
<p>Saved her from death, when she was dead to hope,</p>
<p>And her fond husband had resign'd her up:</p>
<p>So all, like her, may evil fate defy,</p>
<p>If Doctor Glibb, with saving hand, be nigh."</p>
<p class="i1">Fame (now his friend), fear, novelty, and whim,</p>
<p>And fashion, sent the varying sex to him:</p>
<p>From this, contention in the village rose,</p>
<p>And <i>these</i> the Dame espoused, the Doctor <i>those</i>:</p>
<p>The wealthier part, to him and science went;</p>
<div class="linenum">670</div>
<p>With luck and her the poor remain'd content.                   </p>
<p class="i1">The matron sigh'd; for she was vex'd at heart,</p>
<p>With so much profit, so much fame, to part:</p>
<p>"So long successful in my art," she cried,</p>
<p>"And this proud man, so young and so untried!"</p>
<p class="i1">"Nay," said the Doctor, "dare you trust your wives,</p>
<p>The joy, the pride, the solace of your lives,</p>
<p>To one who acts and knows no reason why,</p>
<p>But trusts, poor hag! to luck for an ally?&mdash;</p>
<p>Who, on experience, can her claims advance,</p>
<div class="linenum">680</div>
<p>And own the powers of accident and chance?                     </p>
<p>A whining dame, who prays in danger's view,</p>
<p>(A proof she knows not what beside to do;)</p>
<p>What's her experience? In the time that's gone,</p>
<p>Blundering she wrought, and still she blunders <span class="locked">on:&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</a>
<p>What is Nature? One who acts in aid</p>
<p>Of gossips half asleep, and half afraid.</p>
<p>With such allies I scorn my fame to blend,</p>
<p>Skill is my luck and courage is my friend;</p>
<p>No slave to Nature, 'tis my chief delight</p>
<div class="linenum">690</div>
<p>To win my way and act in her despite:&mdash;                        </p>
<p>"Trust then my art, that, in itself complete,</p>
<p>Needs no assistance and fears no defeat."</p>
<p class="i1">Warm'd by her well-spiced ale and aiding pipe,</p>
<p>The angry matron grew for contest ripe.</p>
<p class="i1">"Can you," she said, "ungrateful and unjust,</p>
<p>Before experience, ostentation trust!</p>
<p>What is your hazard, foolish daughters, tell?</p>
<p>If safe, you're certain; if secure, you're well:</p>
<p>That I have luck must friend and foe confess,</p>
<div class="linenum">700</div>
<p>And what's good judgment but a lucky guess?                    </p>
<p><i>He</i> boasts but what he <i>can</i> do:&mdash;will you run</p>
<p>From me, your friend! who, all <i>he</i> boasts, <i>have</i> done?</p>
<p>By proud and learned words his powers are known;</p>
<p>By healthy boys and handsome girls my own.</p>
<p>Wives! fathers! children! by my help you live;</p>
<p>Has this pale Doctor more than life to give?</p>
<p>No stunted cripple hops the village round;</p>
<p>Your hands are active and your heads are sound:</p>
<p>My lads are all your fields and flocks require;</p>
<div class="linenum">710</div>
<p>My lasses all those sturdy lads admire.                        </p>
<p>Can this proud leech, with all his boasted skill,</p>
<p>Amend the soul or body, wit or will?</p>
<p>Does he for courts the sons of farmers frame,</p>
<p>Or make the daughter differ from the dame?</p>
<p>Or, whom he brings into this world of wo,</p>
<p>Prepares he them their part to undergo?</p>
<p>If not, this stranger from your doors repel,</p>
<p>And be content to <i>be</i>, and to be <i>well</i>."</p>
<p class="i1">She spake; but, ah! with words too strong and plain;</p>
<div class="linenum">720</div>
<p>Her warmth offended, and her truth was vain:                   </p>
<p>The <i>many</i> left her, and the friendly <i>few</i>,</p>
<p>If never colder, yet they older grew;</p>
<p>Till, unemploy'd, she felt her spirits droop,</p>
<p>And took, insidious aid! th' inspiring cup;</p>
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</a>
<p>Grew poor and peevish as her powers decay'd,</p>
<p>And propp'd the tottering frame with stronger <span class="locked">aid;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Then died!&mdash;I saw our careful swains convey,</p>
<p>From this our changeful world, the matron's clay,</p>
<p>Who to this world, at least, with equal care,</p>
<div class="linenum">730</div>
<p>Brought them its changes, good and ill to share.               </p>
<p class="i1">Now to his grave was Roger Cuff convey'd,</p>
<p>And strong resentment's lingering spirit laid.</p>
<p>Shipwreck'd in youth, he home return'd, and found</p>
<p>His brethren three&mdash;and thrice they wish'd him drown'd.</p>
<p>"Is this a landman's love? Be certain then,</p>
<p>We part for ever!"&mdash;and they cried, "Amen!"</p>
<p class="i1">His words were truth's.&mdash;Some forty summers fled;</p>
<p>His brethren died; his kin supposed him dead:</p>
<p>Three nephews these, one sprightly niece, and one,</p>
<div class="linenum">740</div>
<p>Less near in blood&mdash;they call'd him <i>surly John</i>;         </p>
<p>He work'd in woods apart from all his kind.</p>
<p>Fierce were his looks and moody was his mind.</p>
<p class="i1">For home the Sailor now began to <span class="locked">sigh:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"The dogs are dead, and I'll return and die;</p>
<p>When all I have, my gains, in years of care,</p>
<p>The younger Cuffs with kinder souls shall <span class="locked">share.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yet hold! I'm rich;&mdash;with one consent they'll say,</p>
<p>'You're welcome, Uncle, as the flowers in May.'</p>
<p>No; I'll disguise me, be in tatters dress'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">750</div>
<p>And best befriend the lads who treat me best."                 </p>
<p class="i1">Now all his kindred,&mdash;neither rich nor <span class="locked">poor&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Kept the wolf want some distance from the door.</p>
<p class="i1">In piteous plight he knock'd at George's gate,</p>
<p>And begg'd for aid, as he described his <span class="locked">state;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But stern was George:&mdash;"Let them who had thee strong,</p>
<p>Help thee to drag thy weaken'd frame along;</p>
<p>To us a stranger, while your limbs would move,</p>
<p>From us depart and try a stranger's <span class="locked">love:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Ha! dost thou murmur?"&mdash;for, in Roger's throat,</p>
<div class="linenum">760</div>
<p>Was "Rascal!" rising with disdainful note.                     </p>
<p class="i1">To pious James he then his prayer <span class="locked">address'd;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Good lack," quoth James, "thy sorrows pierce my breast;</p>
<p>And, had I wealth, as have my brethren twain,</p>
<p>One board should feed us and one roof contain.</p>
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</a>
<p>But plead I will thy cause and I will pray;</p>
<p>And so farewell! Heaven help thee on thy way!"</p>
<p class="i1">"Scoundrel!" said Roger, (but apart;)&mdash;and told</p>
<p>His case to Peter;&mdash;Peter too was <span class="locked">cold;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"The rates are high; we have a-many poor;</p>
<div class="linenum">770</div>
<p>But I will think,"&mdash;he said, and shut the door.                </p>
<p class="i1">Then the gay Niece the seeming pauper <span class="locked">press'd:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Turn, Nancy, turn, and view this form distress'd;</p>
<p>Akin to thine is this declining frame,</p>
<p>And this poor beggar claims an Uncle's name."</p>
<p class="i1">"Avaunt! begone!" the courteous maiden said,</p>
<p>"Thou vile impostor! Uncle Roger's dead:</p>
<p>I hate thee, beast; thy look my spirit shocks!</p>
<p>Oh! that I saw thee starving in the stocks!"</p>
<p class="i1">"My gentle niece!" he said&mdash;and sought the <span class="locked">wood.&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">780</div>
<p>"I hunger, fellow; prithee, give me food!"                     </p>
<p class="i1">"Give! am I rich? This hatchet take, and try</p>
<p>Thy proper strength, nor give those limbs the lie;</p>
<p>Work, feed thyself, to thine own powers appeal,</p>
<p>Nor whine out woes, thine own right-hand can heal:</p>
<p>And while that hand is thine and thine a leg,</p>
<p>Scorn of the proud or of the base to beg."</p>
<p class="i1">"Come, surly John, thy wealthy kinsman view,"</p>
<p>Old Roger said:&mdash;"thy words are brave and true;</p>
<p>Come, live with me: we'll vex those scoundrel-boys,</p>
<div class="linenum">790</div>
<p>And that prim shrew shall, envying, hear our joys.&mdash;           </p>
<p>Tobacco's glorious fume all day we'll share,</p>
<p>With beef and brandy kill all kinds of care;</p>
<p>We'll beer and biscuit on our table heap,</p>
<p>And rail at rascals, till we fall asleep."</p>
<p class="i1">Such was their life; but when the woodman died,</p>
<p>His grieving kin for Roger's smiles <span class="locked">applied&mdash;</span></p>
<p>In vain; he shut, with stern rebuke, the door,</p>
<p>And dying, built a refuge for the poor:</p>
<p>With this restriction, That no Cuff should share</p>
<div class="linenum">800</div>
<p>One meal, or shelter for one moment there.                     </p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">My record ends:&mdash;But hark! e'en now I hear</p>
<p>The bell of death, and know not whose to fear.</p>
<p>Our farmers all, and all our hinds were well;</p>
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</a>
<p>In no man's cottage danger seem'd to <span class="locked">dwell;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yet death of man proclaim these heavy chimes,</p>
<p>For thrice they sound, with pausing space, three times.</p>
<p class="i1">"Go; of my sexton seek, Whose days are sped?&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">"What! he, himself!&mdash;and is old Dibble dead?"</p>
<p>His eightieth year he reach'd, still undecay'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">810</div>
<p>And rectors five to one close vault convey'd:&mdash;                </p>
<p>But he is gone; his care and skill I lose,</p>
<p>And gain a mournful subject for my Muse:</p>
<p>His masters lost, he'd oft in turn deplore,</p>
<p>And kindly add,&mdash;"Heaven grant, I lose no more!"</p>
<p>Yet, while he spake, a sly and pleasant glance</p>
<p>Appear'd at variance with his complaisance:</p>
<p>For, as he told their fate and varying worth,</p>
<p>He archly look'd,&mdash;"I yet may bear thee forth."</p>
<p>"When first"&mdash;(he so began)&mdash;"my trade I plied,</p>
<div class="linenum">820</div>
<p>Good master Addle was the parish-guide;                        </p>
<p>His clerk and sexton, I beheld with fear</p>
<p>His stride majestic, and his frown severe;</p>
<p>A noble pillar of the church he stood,</p>
<p>Adorn'd with college-gown and parish-hood.</p>
<p>Then as he paced the hallow'd aisles about,</p>
<p>He fill'd the sevenfold surplice fairly out!</p>
<p>But in his pulpit, wearied down with prayer,</p>
<p>He sat and seem'd as in his study's chair;</p>
<p>For while the anthem swell'd, and when it ceased,</p>
<div class="linenum">830</div>
<p>Th' expecting people view'd their slumbering priest:           </p>
<p>Who, dozing, died.&mdash;Our Parson Peele was next;</p>
<p>'I will not spare you,' was his favourite text;</p>
<p>Nor did he spare, but raised them many a pound;</p>
<p>Ev'n me he mulct for my poor rood of ground;</p>
<p>Yet cared he nought, but with a gibing speech,</p>
<p>'What should I do,' quoth he, 'but what <i>I</i> preach?'</p>
<p>His piercing jokes (and he'd a plenteous store)</p>
<p>Were daily offer'd both to rich and poor;</p>
<p>His scorn, his love, in playful words he spoke;</p>
<div class="linenum">840</div>
<p>His pity, praise, and promise, were a joke:                    </p>
<p>But though so young and bless'd with spirits high,</p>
<p>He died as grave as any judge could die:</p>
<p>The strong attack subdued his lively <span class="locked">powers,&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</a>
<p>His was the grave, and Doctor Grandspear ours.</p>
<p class="i1">Then were there golden times the village round;</p>
<p>In his abundance all appear'd t' abound;</p>
<p>Liberal and rich, a plenteous board he spread,</p>
<p>E'en cool Dissenters at his table fed,</p>
<p>Who wish'd, and hoped,&mdash;and thought a man so kind</p>
<div class="linenum">850</div>
<p>A way to Heaven, though not their own, might find;             </p>
<p>To them, to all, he was polite and free,</p>
<p>Kind to the poor, and, ah! most kind to me:</p>
<p>'Ralph,' would he say, 'Ralph Dibble, thou art old;</p>
<p>That doublet fit, 'twill keep thee from the cold.</p>
<p>How does my sexton?&mdash;What! the times are hard;</p>
<p>Drive that stout pig, and pen him in thy yard.'</p>
<p>But most, his rev'rence loved a mirthful <span class="locked">jest:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Thy coat is thin; why, man, thou'rt <i>barely</i> dress'd;</p>
<p>It's worn to th' thread; but I have nappy beer;</p>
<div class="linenum">860</div>
<p>Clap that within, and see how they will wear!'                 </p>
<p class="i1">"Gay days were these; but they were quickly past:</p>
<p>When first he came, we found he cou'dn't last:</p>
<p>A whoreson cough (and at the fall of leaf)</p>
<p>Upset him quite;&mdash;but what's the gain of grief?</p>
<p class="i1">"Then came the Author-Rector; his delight</p>
<p>Was all in books; to read them, or to write:</p>
<p>Women and men he strove alike to shun,</p>
<p>And hurried homeward when his tasks were done,</p>
<p>Courteous enough, but careless what he said,</p>
<div class="linenum">870</div>
<p>For points of learning he reserved his head;                   </p>
<p>And, when addressing either poor or rich,</p>
<p>He knew no better than his cassock which.</p>
<p>He, like an osier, was of pliant kind,</p>
<p>Erect by nature, but to bend inclined;</p>
<p>Not like a creeper falling to the ground,</p>
<p>Or meanly catching on the neighbours <span class="locked">round.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Careless was he of surplice, hood, and <span class="locked">band&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And kindly took them as they came to hand;</p>
<p>Nor, like the doctor, wore a world of hat,</p>
<div class="linenum">880</div>
<p>As if he sought for dignity in that.                           </p>
<p>He talk'd, he gave, but not with cautious rules,</p>
<p>Nor turn'd from gipsies, vagabonds, or fools;</p>
<p>It was his nature, but they thought it whim,</p>
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</a>
<p>And so our beaux and beauties turn'd from him.</p>
<p>Of questions much he wrote, profound and <span class="locked">dark&mdash;</span></p>
<p>How spake the serpent, and where stopp'd the ark;</p>
<p>From what far land the Queen of Sheba came;</p>
<p>Who Salem's priest, and what his father's name;</p>
<p>He made the Song of Songs its mysteries yield,</p>
<div class="linenum">890</div>
<p>And Revelations, to the world, reveal'd.                       </p>
<p>He sleeps i' the aisle&mdash;but not a stone records</p>
<p>His name or fame, his actions or his words:</p>
<p>And, truth, your reverence, when I look around,</p>
<p>And mark the tombs in our sepulchral ground,</p>
<p>(Though dare I not of one man's hope to doubt),</p>
<p>I'd join the party who repose without,</p>
<p class="i1">"Next came a youth from Cambridge, and, in truth,</p>
<p>He was a sober and a comely youth;</p>
<p>He blush'd in meekness as a modest man,</p>
<div class="linenum">900</div>
<p>And gain'd attention ere his task began;                       </p>
<p>When preaching, seldom ventured on reproof,</p>
<p>But touch'd his neighbours tenderly enough.</p>
<p>Him, in his youth, a clamorous sect assail'd,</p>
<p>Advised and censured, flatter'd,&mdash;and <span class="locked">prevail'd.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Then did he much his sober hearers vex,</p>
<p>Confound the simple, and the sad perplex;</p>
<p>To a new style his reverence rashly took;</p>
<p>Loud grew his voice, to threat'ning swell'd his look;</p>
<p>Above, below, on either side, he gazed,</p>
<div class="linenum">910</div>
<p>Amazing all, and most himself amazed:                          </p>
<p>No more he read his preachments pure and plain,</p>
<p>But launch'd outright, and rose and sank again:</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>At times he smiled in scorn, at times he wept,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And such sad coil with words of vengeance kept,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>That our best sleepers started as they slept.                  </p>
<p class="i1">"'Conviction comes like lightning,' he would cry;</p>
<p>'In vain you seek it, and in vain you fly;</p>
<p>'Tis like the rushing of the mighty wind,</p>
<p>Unseen its progress, but its power you find;</p>
<div class="linenum">920</div>
<p>It strikes the child ere yet its reason wakes;                 </p>
<p>His reason fled, the ancient sire it shakes.</p>
<p>The proud, learn'd man, and him who loves to know</p>
<p>How and from whence these gusts of grace will blow,</p>
<p>It shuns,&mdash;but sinners in their way impedes,</p>
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</a>
<p>And sots and harlots visits in their deeds:</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Of faith and penance it supplies the place;                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Assures the vilest that they live by grace,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And, without running, makes them win the race.'                </p>
<p class="i1">"Such was the doctrine our young prophet taught;</p>
<div class="linenum">930</div>
<p>And here conviction, there confusion wrought;                  </p>
<p>When his thin cheek assumed a deadly hue,</p>
<p>And all the rose to one small spot withdrew:</p>
<p>They call'd it hectic; 'twas a fiery flush,</p>
<p>More fix'd and deeper than the maiden blush;</p>
<p>His paler lips the pearly teeth disclosed,</p>
<p>And lab'ring lungs the length'ning speech opposed.</p>
<p>No more his span-girth shanks and quiv'ring thighs</p>
<p>Upheld a body of the smaller size;</p>
<p>But down he sank upon his dying bed,</p>
<div class="linenum">940</div>
<p>And gloomy crotchets fill'd his wandering head.&mdash;              </p>
<p class="i1">"'Spite of my faith, all-saving faith,' he cried,</p>
<p>'I fear of worldly works the wicked pride;</p>
<p>Poor as I am, degraded, abject, blind,</p>
<p>The good I've wrought still rankles in my mind;</p>
<p>My alms-deeds all, and every deed I've done,</p>
<p>My moral-rags defile me, every one;</p>
<p>It should not be&mdash;what say'st thou? tell me, Ralph.'</p>
<p>Quoth I, 'Your reverence, I believe, you're safe;</p>
<p>Your faith's your prop, nor have you pass'd such time</p>
<div class="linenum">950</div>
<p>In life's good-works as swell them to a crime.                 </p>
<p>If I of pardon for my sins were sure,</p>
<p>About my goodness I would rest secure.'</p>
<p class="i1">"Such was his end; and mine approaches fast;</p>
<p>I've seen my best of preachers&mdash;and my <span class="locked">last."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">He bow'd, and archly smiled at what he said,</p>
<p>Civil but sly:&mdash;"And is old Dibble dead?"</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! he is gone: and <span class="smcap">we</span> are going all;</p>
<p>Like flowers we wither, and like leaves we <span class="locked">fall;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Here, with an infant, joyful sponsors come,</p>
<div class="linenum">960</div>
<p>Then bear the new-made Christian to its home;                  </p>
<p>A few short years, and we behold him stand,</p>
<p>To ask a blessing, with his bride in hand:</p>
<p>A few, still seeming shorter, and we hear</p>
<p>His widow weeping at her husband's <span class="locked">bier:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Thus, as the months succeed, shall infants take</p>
<p>Their names; thus parents shall the child forsake;</p>
<p>Thus brides again and bridegrooms blithe shall kneel,</p>
<p>By love or law compell'd their vows to seal,</p>
<p>Ere I again, or one like me, explore</p>

<p class="i1">In Fairy-land, on wide and cheerless plain,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Dwelt, in the house of Care, a sturdy swain;                    </p>
<p>A hireling he, who, when he till'd the soil,</p>
<p>Look'd to the pittance that repaid his toil;</p>
<p>And to a master left the mingled joy</p>
<p>And anxious care that follow'd his employ.</p>
<p>Sullen and patient he at once appear'd,</p>
<p>As one who murmur'd, yet as one who fear'd;</p>
<p>Th' attire was coarse that clothed his sinewy frame,</p>
<p>Rude his address, and Poverty his name.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">In that same plain a nymph, of curious taste,</p>

<p>A cottage (plann'd with all her skill) had placed;              </p>
<p>Strange the materials, and for what design'd</p>
<p>The various parts, no simple man might find;</p>
<p>What seem'd the door, each entering guest withstood,</p>
<p>What seem'd a window was but painted wood;</p>
<p>But by a secret spring the wall would move,</p>
<p>And day-light drop through glassy door above.</p>
<p>'Twas all her pride, new traps for praise to lay,</p>
<p>And all her wisdom was to hide her way;</p>
<p>In small attempts incessant were her pains,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And Cunning was her name among the swains.                      </p>

<p class="i1">Now, whether fate decreed this pair should wed,</p>
<p>And blindly drove them to the marriage-bed;</p>
<p>Or whether love in some soft hour inclined</p>

<p>Is yet unsung: they were an ill-match'd pair,</p>

<p class="i1">Now Fortune changed, who, were she constant long,</p>

<p>From the light bosom drew the sudden sigh;</p>
<p>Unsocial he, but with malignant mind,</p>
<p>He dwelt with man, that he might curse mankind;</p>
<p>Like the first foe, he sought th' abode of Joy,</p>
<p>Grieved to behold, but eager to destroy;</p>
<p>Round blooming beauty, like the wasp, he flew,</p>
<p>Soil'd the fresh sweet, and changed the rosy hue;</p>
<p>The wise, the good, with anxious heart, he saw,</p>
<p>And here a failing found, and there a flaw;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Discord in families 'twas his to move,                         </p>
<p>Distrust in friendship, jealousy in love;</p>
<p>He told the poor, what joys the great possess'd,</p>
<p>The great&mdash;what calm content the cottage bless'd;</p>
<p>To part the learned and the rich he tried,</p>
<p>Till their slow friendship perish'd in their pride.</p>

<p>Exhaust the vigour of a ranc'rous mind?</p>
<p>But, soon as Fame the fairy-gifts proclaim'd,</p>
<p>Quick-rising wrath his ready soul inflamed,</p>

<p>The nymph should weep her varied destiny;</p>
<p>That every gift, that now appear'd to shine</p>
<p>In her fair face, and make her smiles divine,</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me, that this change from restlessness to
repose, in the mind of Sir Eustace, is wrought by a methodistic call; and
it is admitted to be such: a sober and rational conversion could not have
happened while the disorder of the brain continued. Yet the verses which
follow, in a different measure, are not intended to make any religious
persuasion appear ridiculous; they are to be supposed as the effect of
memory in the disordered mind of the speaker, and, though evidently
enthusiastic in respect to language, are not meant to convey any impropriety
of sentiment.</p>

your Grace's attention, was composed in a situation so near to
Belvoir Castle, that the author had all the advantage to be
derived from prospects extensive and beautiful, and from works
of grandeur and sublimity: and, though nothing of the influence
arising from such situation should be discernible in these verses,
either from want of adequate powers in the writer, or because
his subjects do not assimilate with such views, yet would it be
natural for him to indulge a wish, that he might inscribe his
labours to the lord of a scene which perpetually excited his
admiration, and he would plead the propriety of placing the
titles of the House of Rutland at the entrance of a volume
written in the Vale of Belvoir.</p>

<p>But, my Lord, a motive much more powerful than a sense
of propriety, a grateful remembrance of benefits conferred by
the noble family in which you preside, has been the great inducement
for me to wish that I might be permitted to inscribe
this work to your Grace. The honours of that time were to me
unexpected, they were unmerited, and they were transitory;

in some degree restored to the honour of that period; I have
again the happiness to find myself favoured, and my exertions
stimulated, by the condescension of the Duke of Rutland.</p>

<p>It was my fortune, in a poem which yet circulates, to
write of the virtues, talents, and heroic death of Lord Robert
Manners, and to bear witness to the affection of a brother
whose grief was poignant, and to be soothed only by remembrance
of his worth whom he so deeply deplored. In a patron
thus favourably predisposed, my Lord, I might look for much
lenity, and could not fear the severity of critical examination:
from your Grace, who, happily, have no such impediment to
justice, I must not look for the same kind of indulgence. I am
assured, by those whose situation gave them opportunity for
knowledge, and whose abilities and attention guarded them
from error, that I must not expect my failings will escape
detection from want of discernment, neither am I to fear that
any merit will be undistinguished through deficiency of taste.
It is from this information, my Lord, and a consciousness of
much which needs forgiveness, that I entreat your Grace to
read my verses, with a wish, I had almost added, with a
purpose, to be pleased, and to make every possible allowance for
subjects not always pleasing, for manners sometimes gross, and
for language too frequently incorrect.</p>

<p>With the fullest confidence in your Grace's ability and
favour, in the accuracy of your judgment, and the lenity of
your decision; with grateful remembrance of benefits received,
and due consciousness of the little I could merit; with prayers
that your Grace may long enjoy the dignities of the House of
Rutland, and continue to dictate improvement for the surrounding
country&mdash;I terminate an address, in which a fear
of offending your Grace has made me so cautious in my
expressions, that I may justly fear to offend many of my
readers, who will think that something more of animation
should have been excited by the objects I view, the benevolence
I honour, and the gratitude I profess.</p>


<p class="tipr35">I have the honour to be,</p>
<p class="tipr40">    My Lord,</p>
<p class="tipr45">     Your Grace's</p>
<p class="tipr50">        Most obliged</p>
<p class="tipr40">and obedient humble servant,</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="cap"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</a><span class="uc">Whether</span>, if I had not been encouraged by some
proofs of public favour, I should have written the
Poem now before the reader, is a question which I cannot
positively determine; but I will venture to assert, that I should
not, in that case, have committed the work to the press; I
should not have allowed my own opinion of it to have led me
into further disappointment, against the voice of judges impartial
and indifferent, from whose sentence it had been fruitless
to appeal. The success of a late publication, therefore, may be
fairly assigned as the principal cause for the appearance of
this.</p>

<p>When the ensuing Letters were so far written, that I could
form an opinion of them, and when I began to conceive that
they might not be unacceptable to the public, I felt myself
prompted by duty, as well as interest, to put them to the press;
I considered myself bound by gratitude for the favourable
treatment I had already received, to show that I was not
unmindful of it; and, however this might be mixed with other
motives, it operated with considerable force upon my mind,
acting as a stimulus to exertions naturally tardy, and to expectations
easily checked.</p>

<p>It must nevertheless be acknowledged that, although such
favourable opinion had been formed, I was not able, with the
requisite impartiality, to determine the comparative value of an
unpublished manuscript, and a work sent into the world.
Books, like children, when established, have doubtless our
parental affection and good wishes; we rejoice to hear that<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</a>
they are doing well, and are received and respected in good
company: but it is to manuscripts in the study, as to children
in the nursery, that our care, our anxiety, and our tenderness
are principally directed: they are fondled as our endearing
companions, their faults are corrected with the lenity of partial
love, and their good parts are exaggerated by the strength of
parental imagination; nor is it easy even for the more cool and
reasonable among parents, thus circumstanced, to decide upon the
comparative merits of their offspring, whether they be children
of the bed or issue of the brain.</p>

<p>But, however favourable my own opinion may have been,
or may still be, I could not venture to commit so long a Poem
to the press without some endeavour to obtain the more
valuable opinion of less partial judges. At the same time,
I am willing to confess that I have lost some portion of the
timidity once so painful, and that I am encouraged to take upon
myself the decision of various points, which heretofore I
entreated my friends to decide. Those friends were then
my council, whose opinion I was implicitly to follow; they
are now advisers, whose ideas I am at liberty to reject. This
will not, I hope, seem like arrogance: it would be more safe,
it would be more pleasant, still to have that reliance on the
judgment of others; but it cannot always be obtained; nor are
they, however friendly disposed, ever ready to lend a helping
hand to him whom they consider as one who ought by this time
to have cast away the timidity of inexperience, and to have
acquired the courage that would enable him to decide for
himself.</p>

<p>When it is confessed that I have less assistance from my
friends, and that the appearance of this work is, in a great
measure, occasioned by the success of a former, some readers
will, I fear, entertain the opinion that the book before them was
written in haste, and published without due examination and
revisal. Should this opinion be formed, there will doubtless
occur many faults which may appear as originating in neglect.
Now, readers are, I believe, disposed to treat with more than
common severity those writers who have been led into presumption
by the approbation bestowed on their diffidence, and into
idleness and unconcern, by the praises given to their attention.
I am therefore even anxious it should be generally kn<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</a>own that
sufficient time and application were bestowed upon this work,
and by this I mean that no material alteration would be
effected by delay; it is true that this confession removes one
plea for the errors of the book&mdash;want of time, but, in my
opinion, there is not much consolation to be drawn by
reasonable minds from this resource: if a work fails, it appears
to be poor satisfaction when it is observed, that if the author
had taken more care, the event had been less disgraceful.</p>

<p>When the reader enters into the Poem, he will find the
author retired from view, and an imaginary personage brought
forward to describe his Borough for him. To him it seemed
convenient to speak in the first person; but the inhabitant
of a village, in the centre of the kingdom, could not appear in
the character of a residing burgess in a large sea-port; and
when, with this point, was considered what relations were to be
given, what manners delineated, and what situations described,
no method appeared to be so convenient as that of borrowing
the assistance of an ideal friend. By this means the reader is in
some degree kept from view of any particular place; nor will he
perhaps be so likely to determine where those persons reside,
and what their connexions, who are so intimately known to this
man of straw.</p>

<p>From the title of this Poem, some persons will, I fear,
expect a political satire,&mdash;an attack upon corrupt principles in
a general view, or upon the customs and manners of some
particular place; of these they will find nothing satirized,
nothing related. It may be that graver readers would have
preferred a more historical account of so considerable a Borough&mdash;its
charter, privileges, trade, public structures, and subjects of
this kind; but I have an apology for the omission of these
things, in the difficulty of describing them, and in the utter
repugnancy which subsists between the studies and objects of
topography and poetry. What I thought I could best describe,
that I attempted:&mdash;the sea, and the country in the immediate
vicinity; the dwellings, and the inhabitants; some incidents
and characters, with an exhibition of morals and manners,
offensive perhaps to those of extremely delicate feelings, but
sometimes, I hope, neither unamiable nor unaffecting. An
Election indeed forms a part of one Letter, but the evil there
described is one not greatly nor generally deplored, and there
are probably many places of this kind where it is not felt.<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</a></p>

<p>From the variety of relations, characters, and descriptions
which a <span class="smcap">Borough</span> affords, several were rejected which a reader
might reasonably expect to have met with: in this case he is
entreated to believe that these, if they occurred to the author,
were considered by him as beyond his ability, as subjects which
he could not treat in a manner satisfactory to himself. Possibly
the admission of some will be thought to require more apology
than the rejection of others. In such variety, it is to be apprehended,
that almost every reader will find something not
according with his ideas of propriety, or something repulsive
to the tone of his feelings; nor could this be avoided but by
the sacrifice of every event, opinion, and even expression, which
could be thought liable to produce such effect; and this casting
away so largely of our cargo, through fears of danger, though it
might help us to clear it, would render our vessel of little worth
when she came into port. I may likewise entertain a hope,
that this very variety, which gives scope to objection and
censure, will also afford a better chance for approval and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of these objectionable parts many must be to me unknown;
of others some opinion may be formed, and for their admission
some plea may be stated.</p>

<p>In the first Letter is nothing which particularly calls for
remark, except possibly the last line&mdash;giving a promise to the
reader that he should both smile and sigh in the perusal of the
following Letters. This may appear vain, and more than an
author ought to promise; but let it be considered that the
character assumed is that of a friend, who gives an account of
objects, persons, and events to his correspondent, and who was
therefore at liberty, without any imputation of this kind, to
suppose in what manner he would be affected by such
descriptions.</p>

<p>Nothing, I trust, in the second Letter, which relates to the
imitation of what are called weather-stains on buildings, will
seem to any invidious or offensive. I wished to make a comparison
between those minute and curious bodies which cover
the surface of some edifices, and those kinds of stain which are
formed of boles and ochres, and laid on with a brush. Now, as
the work of time cannot be anticipated in such cases, it may be<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</a>
very judicious to have recourse to such expedients as will give
to a recent structure the venerable appearance of antiquity; and
in this case, though I might still observe the vast difference
between the living varieties of nature, and the distant imitation
of the artist, yet I would not forbear to make use of his dexterity,
because he could not clothe my freestone with <i>mucor</i>, <i>lichen</i>,
and <i>byssus</i>.</p>

<p>The wants and mortifications of a poor Clergyman are the
subjects of one portion of the third Letter; and, he being
represented as a stranger in the Borough, it may be necessary
to make some apology for his appearance in the Poem.
Previous to a late meeting of a literary society, whose benevolent
purpose is well known to the public, I was induced by
a friend to compose a few verses, in which, with the general
commendation of the design, should be introduced a hint that
the bounty might be farther extended; these verses a gentleman
did me the honour to recite at the meeting, and they were
printed as an extract from the Poem, to which in fact they may
be called an appendage.</p>

<p>I am now arrived at that part of my work, which I may
expect will bring upon me some animadversion. Religion is a
subject deeply interesting to the minds of many; and, when
these minds are weak, they are often led by a warmth of feeling
into the violence of causeless resentment. I am therefore
anxious that my purpose should be understood; and I wish
to point out what things they are which an author may hold up
to ridicule and be blameless. In referring to the two principal
divisions of enthusiastical teachers, I have denominated them, as
I conceive they are generally called, <i>Calvinistic</i> and <i>Arminian</i>
Methodists. The <i>Arminians</i>, though divided and perhaps
subdivided, are still, when particular accuracy is not intended,
considered as one body, having had, for many years, one head,
who is yet held in high respect by the varying members of the
present day. But the Calvinistic societies are to be looked upon
rather as separate and independent congregations; and it is to
one of these (unconnected, as is supposed, with any other)
I more particularly allude. But while I am making use of
this division, I must entreat that I may not be considered as
one who takes upon him to censure the religious opinions of
any society or individual: the reader will find that the spirit of<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</a>
the enthusiast, and not his opinions, his manners, and not his
creed, have engaged my attention. I have nothing to observe
of the Calvinist and Arminian, considered as such; but my
remarks are pointed at the enthusiast and the bigot, at their
folly and their craft.</p>

<p>To those readers who have seen the journals of the first
Methodists, or the extracts quoted from them by their opposers<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
in the early times of this spiritual influenza, are sufficiently
known all their leading notions and peculiarities; so that
I have no need to enter into such unpleasant inquiries in this
place. I have only to observe that their tenets remain the
same, and have still the former effect on the minds of the
converted. There is yet that imagined contention with the
powers of darkness, that is at once so lamentable and so
ludicrous; there is the same offensive familiarity with the
Deity, with a full trust and confidence both in the immediate
efficacy of their miserably delivered supplications, and in the
reality of numberless small miracles wrought at their request
and for their convenience; there still exists that delusion, by
which some of the most common diseases of the body are
regarded as proofs of the malignity of Satan contending for
dominion over the soul; and there still remains the same
wretched jargon, composed of scriptural language, debased by
vulgar expressions, which has a kind of mystic influence on the
minds of the ignorant. It will be recollected that it is the
abuse of those scriptural terms which I conceive to be improper:
they are doubtless most significant and efficacious when used
with propriety; but it is painful to the mind of a soberly devout
person, when he hears every rise and fall of the animal spirits,
every whim and notion of enthusiastic ignorance, expressed in
the venerable language of the Apostles and Evangelists.</p>

<p>The success of these people is great, but not surprising: as
the powers they claim are given, and come not of education,
many may, and therefore do, fancy they are endowed with
them; so that they who do not venture to become preachers,
yet exert the minor gifts, and gain reputation for the faculty of
prayer, as soon as they can address the Creator in daring flights
of unpremeditated absurdity. The less indigent gain the praise<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</a>
of hospitality, and the more harmonious become distinguished
in their choirs; curiosity is kept alive by succession of ministers,
and self-love is flattered by the consideration that they are the
persons at whom the world wonders; add to this, that, in many
of them, pride is gratified by their consequence as new members
of a sect whom their conversion pleases, and by the liberty,
which as seceders they take, of speaking contemptuously of the
Church and ministers, whom they have relinquished.</p>

<p>Of those denominated <i>Calvinistic Methodists</i> I had principally
one sect in view, or, to adopt the term of its founder,
<i>a church</i>. This <i>church</i> consists of several congregations in town
and country, unknown perhaps in many parts of the kingdom,
but, where known, the cause of much curiosity and some
amusement. To such of my readers as may judge an enthusiastic
teacher and his peculiarities to be unworthy any serious
attention, I would observe that there is something unusually
daring in the boast of this man, who claims the authority of
a messenger sent from God, and declares without hesitation
that his call was immediate; that he is assisted by the sensible
influence of the Spirit, and that miracles are perpetually wrought
in his favour and for his convenience.</p>

<p>As it was and continues to be my desire to give proof that
I had advanced nothing respecting this extraordinary person, his
operations or assertions, which might not be readily justified by
quotations from his own writings, I had collected several of
these and disposed them under certain heads. But I found that
by this means a very disproportioned share of attention must
be given to the subject, and after some consideration, I have
determined to relinquish the design; and, should any have
curiosity to search whether my representation of the temper
and disposition, the spirit and manners, the knowledge and
capacity, of a very popular teacher be correct, he is referred to
about fourscore pamphlets, whose titles will be found on the
covers of the late editions of the <i>Bank of Faith</i>, itself a wonderful
performance, which (according to the turn of mind in the
reader) will either highly excite, or totally extinguish, curiosity.
In these works will be abundantly seen, abuse and contempt of
the Church of England and its ministers; vengeance and virulent<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" class="pagenum">[Pg 273]</a>
denunciation against all offenders; scorn for morality and heathen
virtue, with that kind of learning which the author possesses,
and his peculiar style of composition. A few of the titles placed
below will give some information to the reader respecting the
merit and design of those performances<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>As many of the preacher's subjects are controverted and
nice questions in divinity, he has sometimes allowed himself
relaxation from the severity of study, and favoured his admirers
with the effects of an humbler kind of inspiration, viz. that of the
Muse. It must be confessed that these flights of fancy are very
humble, and have nothing of that daring and mysterious nature
which the prose of the author leads us to expect. <i>The Dimensions
of eternal</i> <span class="smcap">Love</span> is a title of one of his more learned productions,
with which might have been expected (as a fit companion) <i>The
Bounds of infinite Grace</i>; but no such work appears, and possibly
the author considered one attempt of this kind was sufficient to
prove the extent and direction of his abilities.</p>

<p>Of the whole of this mass of inquiry and decision, of denunciation
and instruction (could we suppose it read by
intelligent persons), different opinions would probably be
formed; the more indignant and severe would condemn the
whole as the produce of craft and hypocrisy, while the more
lenient would allow that such things might originate in the
wandering imagination of a dreaming enthusiast.</p>

<p>None of my readers will, I trust, do me so much injustice
as to suppose I have here any other motive than a vindication
of what I have advanced in the verses which describe this kind
of character, or that I had there any other purpose than to
express (what I conceive to be) justifiable indignation against
the assurance, the malignity, and (what is of more importance)
the pernicious influence of such sentiments on the minds of the
simple and ignorant, who, if they give credit to his relations,
must be no more than tools and instruments under the control
and management of one <i>called to be their Apostle</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing would be more easy for me, as I have observed,
than to bring forward quotations such as would justify all <a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" class="pagenum">[Pg 274]</a>I have
advanced; but, even had I room, I cannot tell whether there be
not something degrading in such kind of attack: the reader
might smile at those miraculous accounts, but he would
consider them and the language of the author as beneath his
further attention: I therefore once more refer him to those
pamphlets, which will afford matter for pity and for contempt
by which some would be amused and others astonished&mdash;not
without sorrow, when they reflect that thousands look up to
the writer as a man literally inspired, to whose wants they
administer with their substance, and to whose guidance they
prostrate their spirit and understanding.</p>

<p>Having been so long detained by this Letter, I must not
permit my desire of elucidating what may seem obscure, or of
defending what is liable to misconstruction, any further to
prevail over a wish for brevity, and the fear of giving an air
of importance to subjects which have perhaps little in themselves.</p>

<p>The circumstance recorded in the fifth Letter is a fact;
although it may appear to many almost incredible, that, in this
country, and but few years since, a close and successful man
should be a stranger to the method of increasing money by the
loan of it. The Minister of the place where the honest Fisherman
resided has related to me the apprehension and suspicion
he witnessed. With trembling hand and dubious look, the
careful man received and surveyed the bond given to him; and,
after a sigh or two of lingering mistrust, he placed it in the
coffer whence he had just before taken his cash; for which, and
for whose increase, he now indulged a belief that it was indeed
both promise and security.</p>

<p>If the Letter which treats of Inns should be found to contain
nothing interesting or uncommon; if it describe things
which we behold every day, and some which we do not wish to
behold at any time: let it be considered that this Letter is one
of the shortest, and that from a Poem whose subject was
a Borough, populous and wealthy, these places of public
accommodation could not, without some impropriety, be
excluded.</p>

<p>I entertain the strongest, because the most reasonable, hope
that no liberal practitioner in the Law will be offended by the
notice taken of dishonourable and crafty attorneys. The incre<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</a>ased
difficulty of entering into the profession will in time
render it much more free than it now is from those who
disgrace it; at present such persons remain, and it would not
be difficult to give instances of neglect, ignorance, cruelty,
oppression, and chicanery; nor are they by any means confined
to one part of the country: quacks and impostors are indeed in
every profession, as well with a licence as without one. The
character and actions of <i>Swallow</i> might doubtless be contrasted
by the delineation of an able and upright Solicitor; but this
Letter is of sufficient length, and such persons, without question,
are already known to my readers.</p>

<p>When I observe, under the article Physic, that the young
and less experienced physician will write rather with a view of
making himself known, than to investigate and publish some
useful fact, I would not be thought to extend this remark to all
the publications of such men. I could point out a work, containing
experiments the most judicious, and conclusions the
most interesting, made by a gentleman, then young, which
would have given just celebrity to a man after long practice.
The observation is nevertheless generally true: many opinions
have been adopted and many books written, not that the theory
might be well defended, but that a young physician might be
better known.</p>

<p>If I have in one Letter praised the good-humour of a man
confessedly too inattentive to business, and, in another, if I have
written somewhat sarcastically of "the brick-floored parlour
which the butcher lets:" be credit given to me, that in the
one case I had no intention to apologize for idleness, nor any
design in the other to treat with contempt the resources of the
poor. The good-humour is considered as the consolation of
disappointment, and the room is so mentioned because the lodger
is vain. Most of my readers will perceive this; but I shall be
sorry if by any I am supposed to make pleas for the vices of
men, or treat their wants and infirmities with derision or with
disdain.</p>

<p>It is probable, that really polite people, with cultivated
minds and harmonious tempers, may judge my description of
a Card-club conversation to be highly exaggerated, if not totally
fictitious; and I acknowledge that the club must admit a
particular kind of members to afford such specimens of acrim<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</a>ony
and objurgation. Yet, that such language is spoken, and such
manners exhibited, is most certain, chiefly among those who,
being successful in life, without previous education, not very
nice in their feelings, or very attentive to improprieties, sit
down to game with no other view than that of adding the gain
of the evening to the profits of the day; whom therefore disappointment
itself makes angry, and, when caused by another;
resentful and vindictive.</p>

<p>The Letter on Itinerant Players will to some appear too
harshly written, their profligacy exaggerated, and their distresses
magnified; but, though the respectability of a part of these
people may give us a more favourable view of the whole body,
though some actors be sober, and some managers prudent: still
there is vice and misery left, more than sufficient to justify
my description. But, if I could find only one woman who
(passing forty years on many stages, and sustaining many
principal characters) laments in her unrespected old age, that
there was no workhouse to which she could legally sue
for admission; if I could produce only one female, seduced
upon the boards, and starved in her lodging, compelled by her
poverty to sing, and by her sufferings to weep, without any
prospect but misery, or any consolation but death; if I could
exhibit only one youth who sought refuge from parental
authority in the licentious freedom of a wandering company:
yet, with three such examples, I should feel myself justified in
the account I have given.&mdash;But such characters and sufferings
are common, and there are few of these societies which could
not show members of this description. To some, indeed, the
life has its satisfactions: they never expected to be free from
labour, and their present kind, they think, is light; they have no
delicate ideas of shame, and therefore duns and hisses give them
no other pain than what arises from the fear of not being
trusted, joined with the apprehension that they may have
nothing to subsist upon except their credit.</p>

<p>For the Alms-House itself, its Governors and Inhabitants,
I have not much to offer, in favour of the subject or of the
characters. One of these, <i>Sir Denys Brand</i>, may be considered
as too highly placed for an author (who seldom ventures above
middle-life) to delineate; and indeed I had some idea of reserving
him for another occasion, where he might have appeared with<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</a>
those in his own rank; but then it is most uncertain whether
he would ever appear, and he has been so many years prepared
for the public whenever opportunity might offer, that I have
at length given him place, and though with his inferiors, yet as
a ruler over them. Of these, one (<i>Benbow</i>) may be thought
too low and despicable to be admitted here; but he is a Borough-character,
and, however disgusting in some respects a picture
may be, it will please some, and be tolerated by many, if it can
boast that one merit of being a faithful likeness.</p>

<p><i>Blaney</i> and <i>Clelia</i>, a male and female inhabitant of this
mansion, are drawn at some length; and I may be thought to
have given them attention which they do not merit. I plead
not for the originality, but for the truth, of the character; and,
though it may not be very pleasing, it may be useful to delineate
(for certain minds) these mixtures of levity and vice; people who
are thus incurably vain and determinately worldly; thus devoted
to enjoyment and insensible of shame, and so miserably fond of
their pleasures, that they court even the remembrance with eager
solicitation, by conjuring up the ghosts of departed indulgences
with all the aid that memory can afford them. These characters
demand some attention, because they hold out a warning to that
numerous class of young people who are too lively to be discreet;
to whom the purpose of life is amusement, and who are always
in danger of falling into vicious habits, because they have too
much activity to be quiet, and too little strength to be steady.</p>

<p>The characters of the Hospital-Directors were written
many years since, and, so far as I was capable of judging, are
drawn with <i>fidelity</i>. I mention this circumstance, that, if any
reader should find a difference in the versification or expression,
he will be thus enabled to account for it.</p>

<p>The Poor are here almost of necessity introduced, for they
must be considered, in every place, as a large and interesting
portion of its inhabitants. I am aware of the great difficulty of
acquiring just notions on the maintenance and management of
this class of our fellow-subjects, and I forbear to express any
opinion of the various modes which have been discussed or
adopted: of one method only I venture to give my sentiments,
that of collecting the poor of a hundred into one building. This
admission of a vast number of persons, of all ages and both sexes,
of very different inclinations<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</a>, habits, and capacities, into a society,
must, at a first view, I conceive, be looked upon as a cause of
both vice and misery; nor does anything which I have heard or
read invalidate the opinion; happily, it is not a prevailing one,
as these houses are, I believe, still confined to that part of the
kingdom where they originated.</p>

<p>To this subject follow several Letters describing the follies,
and crimes of persons in lower life, with one relation of a
happier and more consolatory kind. It has been a subject of
greater vexation to me than such trifle ought to be, that I could
not, without destroying all appearance of arrangement, separate
these melancholy narratives, and place the fallen Clerk in Office
at a greater distance from the Clerk of the Parish, especially as
they resembled each other in several particulars; both being
tempted, seduced, and wretched. Yet are there, I conceive,
considerable marks of distinction: their guilt is of different
kind; nor would either have committed the offence of the
other. The Clerk of the Parish could break the commandment,
but he could not have been induced to have disowned an
article of that creed for which he had so bravely contended,
and on which he fully relied; and the upright mind of the Clerk
in Office would have secured him from being guilty of wrong
and robbery, though his weak and vacillating intellect could not
preserve him from infidelity and profaneness. Their melancholy
is nearly alike, but not its consequences. <i>Jachin</i> retained his
belief, and though he hated life, he could never be induced to
quit it voluntarily; but <i>Abel</i> was driven to terminate his misery
in a way which the unfixedness of his religious opinions rather
accelerated than retarded. I am therefore not without hope
that the more observant of my readers will perceive many
marks of discrimination in these characters.</p>

<p>The Life of <i>Ellen Orford</i>, though sufficiently burthened
with error and misfortune, has in it little besides, which
resembles those of the above unhappy men, and is still more
unlike that of <i>Grimes</i>, in a subsequent Letter. There is in
this character cheerfulness and resignation, a more uniform
piety, and an immovable trust in the aid of religion: this, with
the light texture of the introductory part, will, I hope, take off
from that idea of sameness which the repetition of crimes and
distresses is likely to create. The character of <i>Grimes</i>, his
obduracy and apparent want of feeling, his gloomy kind of<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</a>
misanthropy, the progress of his madness, and the horrors of his
imagination, I must leave to the judgment and observation of
my readers. The mind here exhibited is one untouched by
pity, unstung by remorse, and uncorrected by shame: yet is
this hardihood of temper and spirit broken by want, disease,
solitude, and disappointment; and he becomes the victim of a
distempered and horror-stricken fancy. It is evident, therefore,
that no feeble vision, no half-visible ghost, not the momentary
glance of an unbodied being, nor the half-audible voice of an
invisible one, would be created by the continual workings of
distress on a mind so depraved and flinty. The ruffian of
Mr <i>Scott</i><a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> has a mind of this nature: he has no shame or
remorse: but the corrosion of hopeless want, the wasting of
unabating disease, and the gloom of unvaried solitude, will have
their effect on every nature; and, the harder that nature is, and
the longer time required to work upon it, so much the more
strong and indelible is the impression. This is all the reason I
am able to give, why a man of feeling so dull should yet become
insane, should be of so horrible a nature.</p>

<p>That a Letter on Prisons should follow those narratives is
unfortunate, but not to be easily avoided. I confess it is not
pleasant to be detained so long by subjects so repulsive to the
feelings of many as the sufferings of mankind; but, though
I assuredly would have altered this arrangement, had I been
able to have done it by substituting a better, yet am I not of
opinion that my verses, or indeed the verses of any other person,
can so represent the evils and distresses of life as to make any
material impression on the mind, and much less any of
injurious nature. Alas! sufferings real, evident, continually
before us, have not effects very serious or lasting, even in the
minds of the more reflecting and compassionate; nor indeed
does it seem right that the pain caused by sympathy should
serve for more than a stimulus to benevolence. If, then, the
strength and solidity of truth placed before our eyes have effect
so feeble and transitory, I need not be very apprehensive that
my representations of Poor-houses and Prisons, of wants and
sufferings, however faithfully taken, will excite any feelings
which can be seriously lamented. It has always been held as
a salutary exercise of the mind, to contemplate the evils and<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</a>
miseries of our nature. I am not, therefore, without hope, that
even this gloomy subject of Imprisonment, and more especially
the Dream of the condemned Highwayman, will excite in some
minds that mingled pity and abhorrence, which, while it is not
unpleasant to the feelings, is useful in its operation: it ties and
binds us to all mankind by sensations common to us all, and in
some degree connects us, without degradation, even to the most
miserable and guilty of our fellow-men.</p>

<p>Our concluding subject is Education; and some attempt is
made to describe its various seminaries, from that of the Poor
Widow, who pronounces the alphabet for infants, to seats
whence the light of learning is shed abroad on the world.
If, in this Letter, I describe the lives of literary men as embittered
by much evil; if they be often disappointed, and
sometimes unfitted for the world they improve: let it be
considered that they are described as men who possess that
great pleasure, the exercise of their own talents, and the delight
which flows from their own exertions; they have joy in their
pursuits, and glory in their acquirements of knowledge. Their
victory over difficulties affords the most rational cause of triumph,
and the attainment of new ideas leads to incalculable riches,
such as gratify the glorious avarice of aspiring and comprehensive
minds. Here, then, I place the reward of learning.&mdash;Our
Universities produce men of the first scholastic attainments,
who are heirs to large possessions, or descendants from noble
families. Now, to those so favoured, talents and acquirements
are, unquestionably, means of arriving at the most elevated and
important situations; but these must be the lot of a few. In
general, the diligence, acuteness, and perseverance of a youth
at the University, have no other reward than some College
honours and emoluments, which they desire to exchange, many
of them, for very moderate incomes in the obscurity of some
distant village: so that, in stating the reward of an ardent and
powerful mind to consist principally (I might have said entirely)
in its own views, efforts, and excursions, I place it upon a sure
foundation, though not one so elevated as the more ambitious
aspire to. It is surely some encouragement to a studious man
to reflect, that if he be disappointed, he cannot be without
gratification; and that, if he gets but a very humble portion of
what the world can give, he has a continual fruition of unwearying
enjoyment, of which it has not power to deprive<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</a>
him.</p>

<p>Long as I have detained the reader, I take leave to add
a few words on the subject of imitation, or, more plainly
speaking, borrowing. In the course of a long Poem, and
more especially of two long ones, it is very difficult to avoid
a recurrence of the same thoughts, and of similar expressions;
and, however careful I have been myself in detecting and
removing these kinds of repetitions, my readers, I question not,
would, if disposed to seek them, find many remaining. For
these I can only plead that common excuse&mdash;they are the
offences of a bad memory, and not of voluntary inattention; to
which I must add the difficulty (I have already mentioned) of
avoiding the error. This kind of plagiarism will therefore, I
conceive, be treated with lenity; and of the more criminal
kind, borrowing from others, I plead, with much confidence,
"not guilty." But while I claim exemption from guilt, I do
not affirm that much of sentiment and much of expression may
not be detected in the vast collection of English poetry: it
is sufficient for an author, that he uses not the words or ideas of
another without acknowledgment; and this, and no more than
this, I mean, by disclaiming debts of the kind. Yet resemblances
are sometimes so very striking, that it requires faith in a reader
to admit they were undesigned. A line in the second Letter,</p>

<p class="center small">
"And monuments themselves memorials need,"
</p>

<p class="noindent">was written long before the author, in an accidental recourse to
Juvenal, <span class="locked">read&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center small">"Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris."</p>
<p class="tipr60 small">Sat. x. l. 146.</p>

<p class="noindent">and for this I believe the reader will readily give me credit.
But there is another apparent imitation in the life of <i>Blaney</i>
(Letter xiv), a simile of so particular a kind, that its occurrence
to two writers at the same time must appear as an extraordinary
event. For this reason I once determined to exclude it from the
relation, but, as it was truly unborrowed, and suited the place
in which it stood, this seemed, on after-consideration, to be an
act of cowardice, and the lines are therefore printed as they
were written about two months before the very same thought<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</a>
(prosaically drest) appeared in a periodical work of the last summer.
It is highly probable, in these cases, that both may derive
the idea from a forgotten but common source; and in this way
I must entreat the reader to do me justice, by accounting for
other such resemblances, should any be detected.</p>

<p>I know not whether to some readers the placing two or
three Latin quotations to a Letter may not appear pedantic and
ostentatious, while both they and the English ones may be
thought unnecessary. For the necessity I have not much to
advance; but if they be allowable (and certainly the best
writers have adopted them), then, where two or three different
subjects occur, so many of these mottoes seem to be required:
nor will a charge of pedantry remain, when it is considered that
these things are generally taken from some books familiar to the
school-boy, and the selecting them is facilitated by the use of a
book of common-place. Yet, with this help, the task of motto-hunting
has been so unpleasant to me, that I have in various
instances given up the quotation I was in pursuit of, and substituted
such English verse or prose as I could find or invent for
my purpose.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER I.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">"Describe the Borough."&mdash;Though our idle tribe</p>
<p>May love description, can we so describe,</p>
<p>That you shall fairly streets and buildings trace,</p>
<p>And all that gives distinction to a place?</p>
<p>This cannot be; yet, moved by your request,</p>
<p>A part I paint&mdash;let fancy form the rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Cities and towns, the various haunts of men,</p>
<p>Require the pencil; they defy the pen.</p>
<p>Could he, who sang so well the Grecian fleet,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>So well have sung of alley, lane, or street?                    </p>
<p>Can measured lines these various buildings show,</p>
<p>The Town-Hall Turning, or the Prospect Row?</p>
<p>Can I the seats of wealth and want explore,</p>
<p>And lengthen out my lays from door to door?</p>
<p class="i1">Then, let thy fancy aid me.&mdash;I repair</p>
<p>From this tall mansion of our last-year's mayor,</p>
<p>Till we the outskirts of the Borough reach,</p>
<p>And these half-buried buildings next the beach;</p>
<p>Where hang at open doors the net and cork,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>While squalid sea-dames mend the meshy work;                    </p>
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286" class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</a>
<p>Till comes the hour, when, fishing through the tide,</p>
<p>The weary husband throws his freight <span class="locked">aside&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A living mass, which now demands the wife,</p>
<p>Th' alternate labours of their humble life.</p>
<p class="i1">Can scenes like these withdraw thee from thy wood,</p>
<p>Thy upland forest or thy valley's flood?</p>
<p>Seek, then, thy garden's shrubby bound, and look,</p>
<p>As it steals by, upon the bordering brook:</p>
<p>That winding streamlet, limpid, lingering, slow,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Where the reeds whisper when the zephyrs blow;                  </p>
<p>Where in the midst, upon her throne of green,</p>
<p>Sits the large lily<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> as the water's queen;</p>
<p>And makes the current, forced awhile to stay,</p>
<p>Murmur and bubble as it shoots away;</p>
<p>Draw then the strongest contrast to that stream,</p>
<p>And our broad river will before thee seem.</p>
<p class="i1">With ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide,</p>
<p>Flowing, it fills the channel vast and wide;</p>
<p>Then back to sea, with strong majestic sweep</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>It rolls, in ebb yet terrible and deep;                         </p>
<p>Here sampire-banks<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and salt-wort<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> bound the flood;</p>
<p>There stakes and sea-weeds, withering on the mud;</p>
<p>And, higher up, a ridge of all things base,</p>
<p>Which some strong tide has roll'd upon the place.</p>
<p class="i1">Thy gentle river boasts its pigmy boat,</p>
<p>Urged on by pains, half grounded, half afloat;</p>
<p>While at her stern an angler takes his stand,</p>
<p>And marks the fish he purposes to land;</p>
<p>From that clear space, where, in the cheerful ray</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Of the warm sun, the scaly people play.                         </p>
<p class="i1">Far other craft our prouder river shows,</p>
<p>Hoys, pinks and sloops; brigs, brigantines and snows:</p>
<p>Nor angler we on our wide stream descry,</p>
<p>But one poor dredger where his oysters lie:</p>
<p>He, cold and wet, and driving with the tide,</p>
<p>Beats his weak arms against his tarry side,</p>
<p>Then drains the remnant of diluted gin,</p>
<p>To aid the warmth that languishes within;</p>
<p>Renewing oft his poor attempts to beat</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>His tingling fingers into gathering heat.                       </p>
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287" class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</a>
<p class="i1">He shall again be seen when evening comes,</p>
<p>And social parties crowd their favourite rooms;</p>
<p>Where on the table pipes and papers lie,</p>
<p>The steaming bowl or foaming tankard by.</p>
<p>'Tis then, with all these comforts spread around,</p>
<p>They hear the painful dredger's welcome sound;</p>
<p>And few themselves the savoury boon deny,</p>
<p>The food that feeds, the living luxury.</p>
<p class="i1">Yon is our quay! those smaller hoys from town.</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Its various wares, for country-use, bring down;                 </p>
<p>Those laden waggons, in return, impart</p>
<p>The country-produce to the city mart;</p>
<p>Hark to the clamour in that miry road,</p>
<p>Bounded and narrow'd by yon vessels' load;</p>
<p>The lumbering wealth she empties round the place,</p>
<p>Package, and parcel, hogshead, chest, and case;</p>
<p>While the loud seaman and the angry hind,</p>
<p>Mingling in business, bellow to the wind.</p>
<p class="i1">Near these a crew amphibious, in the docks,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Rear, for the sea, those castles on the stocks:                 </p>
<p>See the long keel, which soon the waves must hide;</p>
<p>See the strong ribs which form the roomy side;</p>
<p>Bolts yielding slowly to the sturdiest stroke,</p>
<p>And planks<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which curve and crackle in the smoke.</p>
<p>Around the whole rise cloudy wreaths, and far</p>
<p>Bear the warm pungence of o'er-boiling tar.</p>
<p class="i1">Dabbling on shore half-naked sea-boys crowd,</p>
<p>Swim round a ship, or swing upon the shroud;</p>
<p>Or, in a boat purloin'd, with paddles play,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>And grow familiar with the watery way.                          </p>
<p>Young though they be, they feel whose sons they are;</p>
<p>They know what British seamen do and dare;</p>
<p>Proud of that fame, they raise and they enjoy</p>
<p>The rustic wonder of the village-boy.</p>
<p class="i1">Before you bid these busy scenes adieu,</p>
<p>Behold the wealth that lies in public view,</p>
<p>Those far-extended heaps of coal and coke,</p>
<p>Where fresh-fill'd lime-kilns breathe their stifling smoke.</p>
<p>This shall pass off, and you behold, instead,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>The night-fire gleaming on its chalky bed;                     </p>
<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</a>
<p>When from the light-house brighter beams will rise,</p>
<p>To show the shipman where the shallow lies.</p>
<p class="i1">Thy walks are ever pleasant; every scene</p>
<p>Is rich in beauty, lively, or serene:</p>
<p>Rich&mdash;is that varied view with woods around,</p>
<p>Seen from the seat, within the shrubb'ry bound;</p>
<p>Where shines the distant lake, and where appear</p>
<p>From ruins bolting, unmolested deer;</p>
<p>Lively&mdash;the village-green, the inn, the place</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Where the good widow schools her infant race;                  </p>
<p>Shops, whence are heard the hammer and the saw,</p>
<p>And village-pleasures unreproved by law.</p>
<p>Then, how serene&mdash;when in your favourite room,</p>
<p>Gales from your jasmines soothe the evening gloom;</p>
<p>When from your upland paddock you look down,</p>
<p>And just perceive the smoke which hides the town;</p>
<p>When weary peasants at the close of day</p>
<p>Walk to their cots, and part upon the way;</p>
<p>When cattle slowly cross the shallow brook,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>And shepherds pen their folds, and rest upon their crook.      </p>
<p class="i1">We prune our hedges, prime our slender trees,</p>
<p>And nothing looks untutor'd and at ease;</p>
<p>On the wide heath, or in the flow'ry vale,</p>
<p>We scent the vapours of the sea-born gale;</p>
<p>Broad-beaten paths lead on from stile to stile,</p>
<p>And sewers from streets the road-side banks defile;</p>
<p>Our guarded fields a sense of danger show,</p>
<p>Where garden-crops with corn and clover grow;</p>
<p>Fences are form'd of wreck and placed around</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>(With tenters tipp'd), a strong repulsive bound;               </p>
<p>Wide and deep ditches by the gardens run,</p>
<p>And there in ambush lie the trap and gun;</p>
<p>Or yon broad board, which guards each tempting prize,</p>
<p>"Like a tall bully, lifts its head and lies."</p>
<p class="i1">There stands a cottage with an open door,</p>
<p>Its garden undefended blooms before;</p>
<p>Her wheel is still, and overturn'd her stool,</p>
<p>While the lone widow seeks the neighb'ring pool.</p>
<p>This gives us hope all views of town to <span class="locked">shun&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>No! here are tokens of the sailor-son:                         </p>
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289" class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</a>
<p>That old blue jacket, and that shirt of check,</p>
<p>And silken kerchief for the seaman's neck;</p>
<p>Sea-spoils and shells from many a distant shore,</p>
<p>And furry robe from frozen Labrador.</p>
<p class="i1">Our busy streets and sylvan-walks between,</p>
<p>Fen, marshes, bog and heath all intervene;</p>
<p>Here pits of crag, with spongy, plashy base,</p>
<p>To some enrich th' uncultivated space:</p>
<p>For there are blossoms rare, and curious rush,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>The gale's rich balm, and sun-dew's crimson blush,             </p>
<p>Whose velvet leaf, with radiant beauty dress'd,</p>
<p>Forms a gay pillow for the plover's breast.</p>
<p class="i1">Not distant far, a house, commodious made,</p>
<p>Lonely yet public stands, for Sunday-trade;</p>
<p>Thither, for this day free, gay parties go,</p>
<p>Their tea-house walk, their tippling rendezvous;</p>
<p>There humble couples sit in corner-bowers,</p>
<p>Or gaily ramble for th' allotted hours;</p>
<p>Sailors and lasses from the town attend,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>The servant-lover, the apprentice-friend;                      </p>
<p>With all the idle social tribes who seek</p>
<p>And find their humble pleasures once a week.</p>
<p class="i1">Turn to the watery world!&mdash;but who to thee</p>
<p>(A wonder yet unview'd) shall paint&mdash;the sea?</p>
<p>Various and vast, sublime in all its forms,</p>
<p>When lull'd by zephyrs, or when roused by storms;</p>
<p>Its colours changing, when from clouds and sun</p>
<p>Shades after shades upon the surface run;</p>
<p>Embrown'd and horrid now, and now serene,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>In limpid blue, and evanescent green;                          </p>
<p>And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie,</p>
<p>Lift the fair sail, and cheat th' experienced eye<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">Be it the summer-noon: a sandy space</p>
<p>The ebbing tide has left upon its place;</p>
<p>Then, just the hot and stony beach above,</p>
<p>Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move</p>
<p>(For heated thus, the warmer air ascends,</p>
<p>And with the cooler in its fall contends);</p>
<p>Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>An equal motion, swelling as it sleeps,                        </p>
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290" class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</a>
<p>Then slowly sinking; curling to the strand,</p>
<p>Faint, lazy waves o'ercreep the ridgy sand,</p>
<p>Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow,</p>
<p>And back return in silence, smooth and slow.</p>
<p>Ships in the calm seem anchored; for they glide</p>
<p>On the still sea, urged solely by the tide;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Art thou not present, this calm scene before,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Where all beside is pebbly length of shore,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And far as eye can reach, it can discern no more?              </p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p class="i1">Yet sometimes comes a ruffling cloud, to make      </p>
<p>The quiet surface of the ocean shake;</p>
<p>As an awaken'd giant with a frown</p>
<p>Might show his wrath, and then to sleep sink down.</p>
<p class="i1">View now the winter-storm, above, one cloud,</p>
<p>Black and unbroken, all the skies o'ershroud.</p>
<p>Th' unwieldy porpoise through the day before</p>
<p>Had roll'd in view of boding men on shore;</p>
<p>And sometimes hid, and sometimes show'd, his form,</p>
<p>Dark as the cloud, and furious as the storm.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p class="i1">All where the eye delights, yet dreads, to roam,     </p>
<p>The breaking billows cast the flying foam</p>
<p>Upon the billows rising&mdash;all the deep</p>
<p>Is restless change; the waves so swell'd and steep,</p>
<p>Breaking and sinking, and the sunken swells,</p>
<p>Nor one, one moment, in its station dwells.</p>
<p>But, nearer land, you may the billows trace,</p>
<p>As if contending in their watery chase;</p>
<p>May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach,</p>
<p>Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Curl'd as they come, they strike with furious force,           </p>
<p>And then, re-flowing, take their grating course,</p>
<p>Raking the rounded flints, which ages past</p>
<p>Roll'd by their rage, and shall to ages last.</p>
<p class="i1">Far off, the petrel in the troubled way</p>
<p>Swims with her brood, or flutters in the spray;</p>
<p>She rises often, often drops again,</p>
<p>And sports at ease on the tempestuous main.</p>
<p class="i1">High o'er the restless deep, above the reach</p>
<p>Of gunner's hope, vast flights of wild-ducks stretch;</p>
<a name="Page_291" id="Page_291" class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</a>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Far as the eye can glance on either side,                      </p>
<p>In a broad space and level line they glide;</p>
<p>All in their wedge-like figures from the north,</p>
<p>Day after day, flight after flight, go forth.</p>
<p class="i1">In-shore their passage tribes of sea-gulls urge,</p>
<p>And drop for prey within the sweeping surge;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Oft in the rough opposing blast they fly                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Far back, then turn, and all their force apply,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry;       </p>
<p>Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast,</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>And in the restless ocean dip for rest.                        </p>
<p class="i1">Darkness begins to reign; the louder wind</p>
<p>Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind;</p>
<p>But frights not him, whom evening and the spray</p>
<p>In part conceal&mdash;yon prowler on his way.</p>
<p>Lo! he has something seen; he runs apace,</p>
<p>As if he fear'd companion in the chase;</p>
<p>He sees his prize, and now he turns again,</p>
<p>Slowly and sorrowing&mdash;"Was your search in vain?"</p>
<p>Gruffly he answers, "'Tis a sorry sight!</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>A seaman's body; there'll be more to-night!"                   </p>
<p class="i1">Hark to those sounds! they're from distress at sea:</p>
<p>How quick they come! What terrors may there be!</p>
<p>Yes, 'tis a driven vessel: I discern</p>
<p>Lights, signs of terror, gleaming from the stern;</p>
<p>Others behold them too, and from the town</p>
<p>In various parties seamen hurry down;</p>
<p>Their wives pursue, and damsels urged by dread,</p>
<p>Lest men so dear be into danger led;</p>
<p>Their head the gown has hooded, and their call</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>In this sad night is piercing like the squall;                 </p>
<p>They feel their kinds of power, and when they meet,</p>
<p>Chide, fondle, weep, dare, threaten, or entreat.</p>
<p class="i1">See one poor girl, all terror and alarm,</p>
<p>Has fondly seized upon her lover's arm;</p>
<p>"Thou shalt not venture;" and he answers "No!</p>
<p>I will not"&mdash;still she cries, "Thou shalt not go."</p>
<p class="i1">No need of this; not here the stoutest boat</p>
<p>Can through such breakers, o'er such billows float;</p>
<p>Yet may they view these lights upon the beach,</p>
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292" class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</a>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Which yield them hope, whom help can never reach.              </p>
<p class="i1">From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws</p>
<p>On the wild waves, and all the danger shows;</p>
<p>But shows them beaming in her shining vest,</p>
<p>Terrific splendour! gloom in glory dress'd!</p>
<p>This for a moment, and then clouds again</p>
<p>Hide every beam, and fear and darkness reign.</p>
<p class="i1">But hear we now those sounds? Do lights appear?</p>
<p>I see them not! the storm alone I hear:</p>
<p>And lo! the sailors homeward take their way;</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>Man must endure&mdash;let us submit and pray.                       </p>
<p class="i1">Such are our winter-views; but night comes <span class="locked">on&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Now business sleeps, and daily cares are gone;</p>
<p>Now parties form, and some their friends assist</p>
<p>To waste the idle hours at sober whist;</p>
<p>The tavern's pleasure or the concert's charm</p>
<p>Unnumber'd moments of their sting disarm;</p>
<p>Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite,</p>
<p>To pass off one dread portion of the night;</p>
<p>And show and song and luxury combined</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>Lift off from man this burthen of mankind.                     </p>
<p class="i1">Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet</p>
<p>Returning parties pacing through the street;</p>
<p>When various voices, in the dying day,</p>
<p>Hum in our walks, and greet us in our way;</p>
<p>When tavern-lights flit on from room to room,</p>
<p>And guide the tippling sailor, staggering home:</p>
<p>There as we pass, the jingling bells betray</p>
<p>How business rises with the closing day:</p>
<p>Now walking silent, by the river's side,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>The ear perceives the rippling of the tide;                    </p>
<p>Or measured cadence of the lads who tow</p>
<p>Some enter'd hoy, to fix her in her row;</p>
<p>Or hollow sound, which from the parish-bell</p>
<p>To some departed spirit bids farewell!</p>
<p class="i1">Thus shall you something of our <span class="smcap">Borough</span> know,</p>
<p>Far as a verse, with Fancy's aid, can show;</p>
<p>Of sea or river, of a quay or street,</p>
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293" class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</a>
<p>The best description must be incomplete;</p>
<p>But when a happier theme [succeeds], and when</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Men are our subjects and the deeds of men;                     </p>
<p>Then may we find the Muse in happier style,</p>
<p>And we may sometimes sigh and sometimes smile.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER II.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE CHURCH.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">"What is a Church?"&mdash;Let Truth and Reason speak,</p>
<p>They would reply, "The faithful, pure, and meek;</p>
<p>From Christian folds the one selected race,</p>
<p>Of all professions, and in every place."</p>
<p class="i1">"What is a Church?"&mdash;"A flock," our vicar cries,</p>
<p>"Whom bishops govern and whom priests advise;</p>
<p>Wherein are various states and due degrees,</p>
<p>The bench for honour, and the stall for ease;</p>
<p>That ease be mine, which, after all his cares,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>The pious, peaceful prebendary shares."                         </p>
<p class="i1">"What is a Church?"&mdash;Our honest sexton tells,</p>
<p>"'Tis a tall building, with a tower and bells;</p>
<p>Where priest and clerk with joint exertion strive</p>
<p>To keep the ardour of their flock alive:</p>
<p>That, by his periods eloquent and grave;</p>
<p>This, by responses, and a well-set stave.</p>
<p>These for the living; but, when life be fled,</p>
<p>I toll myself the requiem for the dead."</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis to this Church I call thee, and that place</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Where slept our fathers, when they'd run their race.            </p>
<p>We too shall rest, and then our children keep</p>
<p>Their road in life, and then, forgotten, sleep;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the building slowly falls away,</p>
<p>And, like the builders, will in time decay.</p>
<p class="i1">The old foundation&mdash;but it is not clear</p>
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296" class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</a>
<p>When it was laid&mdash;you care not for the year:</p>
<p>On this, as parts decay'd by time and storms,</p>
<p>Arose these various disproportion'd forms;</p>
<p>Yet Gothic, all the learn'd who visit us</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>(And our small wonders) have decided thus:                      </p>
<p>"Yon noble Gothic arch;" "That Gothic door;"</p>
<p>So have they said; of proof you'll need no more.</p>
<p class="i1">Here large plain columns rise in solemn style:</p>
<p>You'd love the gloom they make in either aile,</p>
<p>When the sun's rays, enfeebled as they pass</p>
<p>(And shorn of splendour) through the storied glass,</p>
<p>Faintly display the figures on the floor,</p>
<p>Which pleased distinctly in their place before.</p>
<p class="i1">But, ere you enter, yon bold tower survey,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Tall and entire, and venerably gray;                            </p>
<p>For time has soften'd what was harsh when new,</p>
<p>And now the stains are all of sober <span class="locked">hue&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The living stains which Nature's hand alone,</p>
<p>Profuse of life, pours forth upon the stone,</p>
<p>For ever growing; where the common eye</p>
<p>Can but the bare and rocky bed descry,</p>
<p>There Science loves to trace her tribes minute,</p>
<p>The juiceless foliage, and the tasteless fruit;</p>
<p>There she perceives them round the surface creep,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>And, while they meet, their due distinction keep,               </p>
<p>Mix'd but not blended; each its name retains,</p>
<p>And these are Nature's ever-during stains.</p>
<p class="i1">And would'st thou, artist, with thy tints and brush,</p>
<p>Form shades like these? Pretender, where thy blush?</p>
<p>In three short hours shall thy presuming hand</p>
<p>Th' effect of three slow centuries command<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>?</p>
<p>Thou may'st thy various greens and grays contrive:</p>
<p>They are not lichens, nor like aught <span class="locked">alive.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But yet proceed, and when thy tints are lost,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Fled in the shower, or crumbled by the frost;                   </p>
<p>When all thy work is done away as clean</p>
<p>As if thou never spread'st thy gray and green:</p>
<p>Then may'st thou see how Nature's work is done,</p>
<p>How slowly true she lays her colours on;</p>
<p>When her least speck upon the hardest flint</p>
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297" class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</a>
<p>Has mark and form and is a living tint,</p>
<p>And so embodied with the rock, that few</p>
<p>Can the small germ upon the substance view<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">Seeds, to our eye invisible, will find</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>On the rude rock the bed that fits their kind;                  </p>
<p>There, in the rugged soil, they safely dwell,</p>
<p>Till showers and snows the subtle atoms swell,</p>
<p>And spread th' enduring foliage;&mdash;then we trace</p>
<p>The freckled flower upon the flinty base;</p>
<p>These all increase, till in unnoticed years</p>
<p>The stony tower as gray with age appears;</p>
<p>With coats of vegetation, thinly spread,</p>
<p>Coat above coat, the living on the dead.</p>
<p>These then dissolve to dust, and make a way</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>For bolder foliage, nursed by their decay;                      </p>
<p>The long-enduring ferns in time will all</p>
<p>Die and depose their dust upon the wall,</p>
<p>Where the wing'd seed may rest, till many a flower</p>
<p>Show Flora's triumph o'er the falling tower.</p>
<p class="i1">But ours yet stands, and has its bells renown'd</p>
<p>For size magnificent and solemn sound.</p>
<p>Each has its motto: some contrived to tell,</p>
<p>In monkish rhyme, the uses of a bell<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;</p>
<p>Such wond'rous good, as few conceive could spring</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>From ten loud coppers when their clappers swing.                </p>
<p>Enter'd the Church, we to a tomb proceed,</p>
<p>Whose names and titles few attempt to read;</p>
<p>Old English letters, and those half pick'd out,</p>
<p>Leave us, unskilful readers, much in doubt.</p>
<p>Our sons shall see its more degraded state;</p>
<p>The tomb of grandeur hastens to its fate;</p>
<p>That marble arch, our sexton's favourite show,</p>
<p>With all those ruff'd and painted pairs <span class="locked">below&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The noble lady and the lord who rest</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Supine, as courtly dame and warrior dress'd&mdash;                  </p>
<p>All are departed from their state sublime,</p>
<p>Mangled and wounded in their war with time,</p>
<p>Colleagued with mischief; here a leg is fled,</p>
<p>And lo! the baron with but half a head;</p>
<p>Midway is cleft the arch; the very base</p>
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298" class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</a>
<p>Is batter'd round and shifted from its place.</p>
<p class="i1">Wonder not, mortal, at thy quick <span class="locked">decay&mdash;</span></p>
<p>See! men of marble piece-meal melt away;</p>
<p>When whose the image we no longer read,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>But monuments themselves memorials need<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.                    </p>
<p class="i1">With few such stately proofs of grief or pride,</p>
<p>By wealth erected, is our Church supplied;</p>
<p>But we have mural tablets, every size,</p>
<p>That wo could wish, or vanity devise.</p>
<p class="i1">Death levels man,&mdash;the wicked and the just,</p>
<p>The wise, the weak, lie blended in the dust;</p>
<p>And by the honours dealt to every name,</p>
<p>The king of terrors seems to level fame.</p>
<p>&mdash;See here lamented wives, and every wife</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>The pride and comfort of her husband's life;                   </p>
<p>Here to her spouse, with every virtue graced,</p>
<p>His mournful widow has a trophy placed;</p>
<p>And here 'tis doubtful if the duteous son,</p>
<p>Or the good father, be in praise outdone.</p>
<p class="i1">This may be nature; when our friends we lose,</p>
<p>Our alter'd feelings alter too our views;</p>
<p>What in their tempers teased us or distress'd,</p>
<p>Is, with our anger and the dead, at rest;</p>
<p>And much we grieve, no longer trial made,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>For that impatience which we then display'd;                   </p>
<p>Now to their love and worth of every kind</p>
<p>A soft compunction turns th' afflicted mind;</p>
<p>Virtues, neglected then, adored become,</p>
<p>And graces slighted blossom on the tomb.</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis well; but let not love nor grief believe</p>
<p>That we assent (who neither loved nor grieve)</p>
<p>To all that praise which on the tomb is read,</p>
<p>To all that passion dictates for the dead;</p>
<p>But, more indignant, we the tomb deride,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Whose bold inscription flattery sells to pride.                </p>
<p class="i1">Read of this Burgess&mdash;on the stone appear,</p>
<p>How worthy he! how virtuous! and how dear!</p>

<p>See! he was liberal, kind, religious, wise,</p>
<p>And free from all disgrace and all disguise;</p>
<p>His sterling worth, which words cannot express,</p>
<p>Lives with his friends, their pride and their distress.</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p class="i1">All this of Jacob Holmes? for his the name,       </p>
<p>He thus kind, liberal, just, religious?&mdash;shame!</p>
<p>What is the truth? Old Jacob married thrice;</p>
<p>He dealt in coals, and av'rice was his vice;</p>
<p>He ruled the Borough when his year came on,</p>
<p>And some forget, and some are glad he's gone;</p>
<p>For never yet with shilling could he part,</p>
<p>But when it left his hand, it struck his heart.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, here will love its last attentions pay,</p>
<p>And place memorials on these beds of clay.</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Large level stones lie flat upon the grave,                    </p>
<p>And half a century's sun and tempest brave;</p>
<p>But many an honest tear and heart-felt sigh</p>
<p>Have follow'd those who now unnoticed lie;</p>
<p>Of these what numbers rest on every side!</p>
<p>Without one token left by grief or pride;</p>
<p>Their graves soon levell'd to the earth, and then</p>
<p>Will other hillocks rise o'er other men;</p>
<p>Daily the dead on the decay'd are thrust,</p>
<p>And generations follow, "dust to dust."</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p class="i1">Yes! there are real mourners&mdash;I have seen        </p>
<p>A fair, sad girl, mild, suffering, and serene;</p>
<p>Attention (through the day) her duties claim'd,</p>
<p>And to be useful as resign'd she aim'd;</p>
<p>Neatly she dress'd, nor vainly seem'd t' expect</p>
<p>Pity for grief, or pardon for neglect.</p>
<p>But, when her wearied parents sunk to sleep,</p>
<p>She sought her place to meditate and weep:</p>
<p>Then to her mind was all the past display'd,</p>
<p>That faithful memory brings to sorrow's aid:</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>For then she thought on one regretted youth,                   </p>
<p>Her tender trust, and his unquestion'd truth;</p>
<p>In ev'ry place she wander'd where they'd been,</p>
<p>And sadly-sacred held the parting-scene,</p>
<p>Where last for sea he took his leave&mdash;that place</p>
<p>With double interest would she nightly trace;</p>
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300" class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</a>
<p>For long the courtship was, and he would say,</p>
<p>Each time he sail'd,&mdash;"This once, and then the day."</p>
<p>Yet prudence tarried; but, when last he went,</p>
<p>He drew from pitying love a full consent.</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p class="i1">Happy he sail'd, and great the care she took,      </p>
<p>That he should softly sleep, and smartly look;</p>
<p>White was his better linen, and his check</p>
<p>Was made more trim than any on the deck;</p>
<p>And every comfort men at sea can know</p>
<p>Was hers to buy, to make, and to bestow:</p>
<p>For he to Greenland sail'd, and much she told,</p>
<p>How he should guard against the climate's cold;</p>
<p>Yet saw not danger; dangers he'd withstood,</p>
<p>Nor could she trace the fever in his blood.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek,                </p>
<p>And he too smiled, but seldom would he speak;</p>
<p>For now he found the danger, felt the pain,</p>
<p>With grievous symptoms he could not explain;</p>
<p>Hope was awaken'd, as for home he sail'd,</p>
<p>But quickly sank, and never more prevail'd.</p>
<p class="i1">He call'd his friend, and prefaced with a sigh</p>
<p>A lover's message&mdash;"Thomas, I must die.</p>
<p>Would I could see my Sally, and could rest</p>
<p>My throbbing temples on her faithful breast,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>And gazing go!&mdash;if not, this trifle take,                      </p>
<p>And say, till death I wore it for her sake.</p>
<p>Yes! I must die&mdash;blow on, sweet breeze, blow on!</p>
<p>Give me one look, before my life be gone,</p>
<p>Oh! give me that, and let me not despair,</p>
<p>One last fond look&mdash;and now repeat the prayer."</p>
<p class="i1">He had his wish, had more; I will not paint</p>
<p>The lovers' meeting: she beheld him <span class="locked">faint&mdash;</span></p>
<p>With tender fears she took a nearer view,</p>
<p>Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew;</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>He tried to smile, and, half succeeding, said,                 </p>
<p>"Yes! I must die;" and hope for ever fled.</p>
<p class="i1">Still long she nursed him: tender thoughts meantime</p>
<p>Were interchanged, and hopes and views sublime.</p>
<p>To her he came to die, and every day</p>
<p>She took some portion of the dread away;</p>
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301" class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</a>
<p>With him she pray'd, to him his Bible read,</p>
<p>Soothed the faint heart, and held the aching head.</p>
<p>She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer;</p>
<p>Apart, she sigh'd; alone, she shed the tear;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Then, as if breaking from a cloud, she gave                    </p>
<p>Fresh light, and gilt the prospect of the grave.</p>
<p class="i1">One day he lighter seem'd, and they forgot</p>
<p>The care, the dread, the anguish of their lot;</p>
<p>They spoke with cheerfulness, and seem'd to think,</p>
<p>Yet said not so&mdash;"Perhaps he will not sink."</p>
<p>A sudden brightness in his look appear'd,</p>
<p>A sudden vigour in his voice was <span class="locked">heard;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>She had been reading in the Book of Prayer,</p>
<p>And led him forth, and placed him in his chair;</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Lively he seem'd, and spoke of all he knew,                    </p>
<p>The friendly many, and the favourite few;</p>
<p>Nor one that day did he to mind recall</p>
<p>But she has treasured, and she loves them all;</p>
<p>When in her way she meets them, they appear</p>
<p>Peculiar people&mdash;death has made them dear.</p>
<p>He named his friend, but then his hand she press'd,</p>
<p>And fondly whisper'd, "Thou must go to rest;"</p>
<p>"I go," he said; but, as he spoke, she found</p>
<p>His hand more cold, and fluttering was the sound!</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Then gazed affrighten'd; but she caught a last,                </p>
<p>A dying look of love&mdash;and all was past!</p>
<p class="i1">She placed a decent stone his grave above,</p>
<p>Neatly engraved&mdash;an offering of her love;</p>
<p>For that she wrought, for that forsook her bed,</p>
<p>Awake alike to duty and the dead;</p>
<p>She would have grieved, had friends presumed to spare</p>
<p>The least assistance&mdash;'twas her proper care.</p>
<p class="i1">Here will she come, and on the grave will sit,</p>
<p>Folding her arms, in long abstracted fit;</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>But if observer pass, will take her round,                     </p>
<p>And careless seem, for she would not be found;</p>
<p>Then go again, and thus her hour employ,</p>
<p>While visions please her, and while woes destroy.</p>
<p class="i1">Forbear, sweet maid! nor be by fancy led</p>
<p>To hold mysterious converse with the dead;</p>
<p>For sure at length thy [thoughts'], thy [spirit's] pain</p>
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302" class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</a>

<p>All have their tasks and trials; thine are hard,</p>
<p>But short the time, and glorious the reward:</p>

<p>This kind of vegetation, as it begins upon siliceous stones, is very thin,
and frequently not to be distinguished from the surface of the flint. The
byssus jolithus of Linnæus (lepraria jolithus of the present system), an
adhesive carmine crust on rocks and old buildings, was, even by scientific
persons, taken for the substance on which it spread. A great variety of
these minute vegetables are to be found in some parts of the coast, where
the beach, formed of stones of various kinds, is undisturbed, and exposed
to every change of weather; in this situation the different species of
lichen, in their different stages of growth, have an appearance interesting
and agreeable even to those who are ignorant of, and indifferent to, the
cause.</p>

<p>It has been observed to me, that in the first part of the story I have

from which it should appear that the concluding advice is unnecessary;
but if the reader will construe the expression "to the living live," into the

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">Where ends our chancel in a vaulted space,</p>
<p>Sleep the departed vicars of the place;</p>
<p>Of most, all mention, memory, thought are <span class="locked">past&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But take a slight memorial of the last.</p>
<p class="i1">To what famed college we our Vicar owe,</p>
<p>To what fair county, let historians show.</p>
<p>Few now remember when the mild young man,</p>
<p>Ruddy and fair, his Sunday-task began;</p>
<p>Few live to speak of that soft soothing look</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>He cast around, as he prepared his book;                        </p>
<p>It was a kind of supplicating smile,</p>
<p>But nothing hopeless of applause, the while;</p>
<p>And when he finish'd, his corrected pride</p>
<p>Felt the desert, and yet the praise denied.</p>
<p>Thus he his race began, and to the end</p>
<p>His constant care was, no man to offend;</p>
<p>No haughty virtues stirr'd his peaceful mind,</p>
<p>Nor urged the priest to leave the flock behind;</p>
<p>He was his Master's soldier, but not one</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>To lead an army of his martyrs on:                              </p>
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305" class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</a>
<p>Fear was his ruling passion; yet was love,</p>
<p>Of timid kind, once known his heart to move;</p>
<p>It led his patient spirit where it paid</p>
<p>Its languid offerings to a listening maid;</p>
<p>She, with her widow'd mother, heard him speak,</p>
<p>And sought awhile to find what he would seek.</p>
<p>Smiling he came, he smiled when he withdrew,</p>
<p>And paid the same attention to the two;</p>
<p>Meeting and parting without joy or pain,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>He seem'd to come that he might go again.                       </p>
<p>The wondering girl, no prude, but something nice,</p>
<p>At length was chill'd by his unmelting ice;</p>
<p>She found her tortoise held such sluggish pace,</p>
<p>That she must turn and meet him in the chase.</p>
<p>This not approving, she withdrew till one</p>
<p>Came who appeared with livelier hope to run;</p>
<p>Who sought a readier way the heart to move,</p>
<p>Than by faint dalliance of unfixing love.</p>
<p class="i1">Accuse me not that I approving paint</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Impatient hope or love without restraint;                       </p>
<p>Or think the passions, a tumultuous throng,</p>
<p>Strong as they are, ungovernably strong:</p>
<p>But is the laurel to the soldier due,</p>
<p>Who cautious comes not into danger's view?</p>
<p>What worth has virtue by desire untried,</p>
<p>When Nature's self enlists on duty's side?</p>
<p class="i1">The married dame in vain assail'd the truth</p>
<p>And guarded bosom of the Hebrew youth;</p>
<p>But with the daughter of the Priest of On</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>The love was lawful, and the guard was gone;                    </p>
<p>But Joseph's fame had lessen'd in our view,</p>
<p>Had he, refusing, fled the maiden too.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet our good priest to Joseph's praise aspired,</p>
<p>As once rejecting what his heart desired;</p>
<p>"I am escaped," he said, when none pursued;</p>
<p>When none attack'd him, "I am unsubdued;"</p>
<p>"Oh pleasing pangs of love," he sang again,</p>
<p>Cold to the joy, and stranger to the pain.</p>
<p>Ev'n in his age would he address the young,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>"I too have felt these fires, and they are strong;"             </p>
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306" class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</a>
<p>But from the time he left his favourite maid,</p>
<p>To ancient females his devoirs were paid;</p>
<p>And still they miss him after morning prayer;</p>
<p>Nor yet successor fills the Vicar's chair,</p>
<p>Where kindred spirits in his praise agree,</p>
<p>A happy few, as mild and cool as <span class="locked">he&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The easy followers in the female train,</p>
<p>Led without love, and captives without chain.</p>
<p class="i1">Ye lilies male! think (as your tea you sip,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>While the town small-talk flows from lip to lip;                </p>
<p>Intrigues half-gather'd, conversation-scraps,</p>
<p>Kitchen-cabals, and nursery-mishaps)</p>
<p>If the vast world may not some scene produce,</p>
<p>Some state, where your small talents might have use.</p>
<p>Within seraglios you might harmless move,</p>
<p>'Mid ranks of beauty, and in haunts of love;</p>
<p>There from too daring man the treasures guard,</p>
<p>An easy duty, and its own reward;</p>
<p>Nature's soft substitutes, you there might save</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>From crime the tyrant, and from wrong the slave.                </p>
<p class="i1">But let applause be dealt in all we may:</p>
<p>Our priest was cheerful, and in season gay;</p>
<p>His frequent visits seldom fail'd to please;</p>
<p>Easy himself, he sought his neighbour's ease.</p>
<p>To a small garden with delight he came,</p>
<p>And gave successive flowers a summer's fame;</p>
<p>These he presented with a grace his own</p>
<p>To his fair friends, and made their beauties known,</p>
<p>Not without moral compliment: how they</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>"Like flowers were sweet, and must like flowers decay."         </p>
<p class="i1">Simple he was, and loved the simple truth,</p>
<p>Yet had some useful cunning from his youth;</p>
<p>A cunning never to dishonour lent,</p>
<p>And rather for defence than conquest meant;</p>
<p>'Twas fear of power, with some desire to rise,</p>
<p>But not enough to make him enemies;</p>
<p>He ever aim'd to please; and to offend</p>
<p>Was ever cautious; for he sought a friend;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Yet for the friendship never much would pay,                   </p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Content to bow, be silent, and obey,                           </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307" class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</a>
<p>And by a soothing suff'rance find his way.                     </p>
<p class="i1">Fiddling and fishing were his arts; at times</p>
<p>He alter'd sermons, and he aim'd at rhymes;</p>
<p>And his fair friends, not yet intent on cards,</p>
<p>Oft he amused with riddles and charades.</p>
<p class="i1">Mild were his doctrines, and not one discourse</p>
<p>But gain'd in softness what it lost in force:</p>
<p>Kind his opinions; he would not receive</p>
<p>An ill report, nor evil act believe;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>"If true, 'twas wrong; but blemish great or small              </p>
<p>Have all mankind; yea, sinners are we all."</p>
<p class="i1">If ever fretful thought disturbed his breast,</p>
<p>If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress'd,</p>
<p>It sprang from innovation; it was then</p>
<p>He spake of mischief made by restless men,</p>
<p>Not by new doctrines: never in his life</p>
<p>Would he attend to controversial strife;</p>
<p>For sects he cared not; "They are not of us,</p>
<p>Nor need we, brethren, their concerns discuss;</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>But 'tis the change, the schism at home I feel;                </p>
<p>Ills few perceive, and none have skill to heal:</p>
<p>Not at the altar our young brethren read</p>
<p>(Facing their flock) the decalogue and creed;</p>
<p>But at their duty, in their desks they stand,</p>
<p>With naked surplice, lacking hood and band:</p>
<p>Churches are now of holy song bereft,</p>
<p>And half our ancient customs changed or left;</p>
<p>Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen,</p>
<p>Nor crimson berry tips the holly's green;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain                       </p>
<p>Of ancient Sternhold, which from ours amain</p>
<p>[Comes] flying forth, from aile to aile about,</p>
<p>Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out."</p>
<p class="i1">These were to him essentials, all things new</p>
<p>He deem'd superfluous, useless, or untrue;</p>
<p>To all beside indifferent, easy, cold,</p>
<p>Here the fire kindled, and the wo was told.</p>
<p class="i1">Habit with him was all the test of truth,</p>
<p>"It must be right: I've done it from my youth."</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Questions he answer'd in as brief a way,                       </p>
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308" class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</a>
<p>"It must be wrong&mdash;it was of yesterday."</p>
<p class="i1">Though mild benevolence our priest possess'd,</p>
<p>'Twas but by wishes or by words express'd:</p>
<p>Circles in water, as they wider flow,</p>
<p>The less conspicuous, in their progress grow;</p>
<p>And when at last they touch upon the shore,</p>
<p>Distinction ceases, and they're view'd no more.</p>
<p>His love, like that last circle, all embraced,</p>
<p>But with effect that never could be traced.</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p class="i1">Now rests our Vicar. They who knew him best       </p>
<p>Proclaim his life t' have been entirely <span class="locked">rest&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Free from all evils which disturb his mind</p>
<p>Whom studies vex and controversies blind.</p>
<p class="i1">The rich approved&mdash;of them in awe he stood;</p>
<p>The poor admired&mdash;they all believed him good;</p>
<p>The old and serious of his habits spoke;</p>
<p>The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke;</p>
<p>Mothers approved a safe contented guest,</p>
<p>And daughters one who back'd each small request:</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>In him his flock found nothing to condemn;                     </p>
<p>Him sectaries liked&mdash;he never troubled them;</p>
<p>No trifles fail'd his yielding mind to please,</p>
<p>And all his passions sunk in early ease;</p>
<p>Nor one so old has left this world of sin,</p>
<p>More like the being that he entered in.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE CURATE.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>Ask you what lands our pastor tithes?&mdash;Alas!</p>
<p>But few our acres, and but short our grass:</p>
<p>In some fat pastures of the rich, indeed,</p>
<p>May roll the single cow or favourite steed,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Who, stable-fed, is here for pleasure seen,                    </p>
<p>His sleek sides bathing in the dewy green:</p>
<p>But these, our hilly heath and common wide,</p>
<p>Yield a slight portion for the parish-guide;</p>
<p>No crops luxuriant in our borders stand,</p>
<p>For here we plough the ocean, not the land;</p>
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309" class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</a>
<p>Still reason wills that we our pastor pay,</p>
<p>And custom does it on a certain day.</p>
<p>Much is the duty, small the legal due,</p>
<p>And this with grateful minds we keep in view;</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Each makes his off'ring, some by habit led,                    </p>
<p>Some by the thought, that all men must be fed;</p>
<p>Duty and love, and piety and pride,</p>
<p>have each their force, and for the priest provide.</p>
<p class="i1">Not thus our Curate, one whom all believe</p>
<p>Pious and just, and for whose fate they grieve;</p>
<p>All see him poor, but ev'n the vulgar know</p>
<p>He merits love, and their respect bestow.</p>
<p>A man so learn'd you shall but seldom see,</p>
<p>Nor one so honour'd, so aggrieved as <span class="locked">he&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Not grieved by years alone; though his appear                  </p>
<p>Dark and more dark, severer on severe:</p>
<p>Not in his need,&mdash;and yet we all must grant</p>
<p>How painful 'tis for feeling age to want;</p>
<p>Nor in his body's sufferings&mdash;yet we know</p>
<p>Where time has plough'd, there misery loves to sow:</p>
<p>But in the wearied mind, that all in vain</p>
<p>Wars with distress, and struggles with its pain.</p>
<p class="i1">His father saw his powers&mdash;"I'll give," quoth he,</p>
<p>"My first-born learning; 'twill a portion be."</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Unhappy gift! a portion for a son!                             </p>
<p>But all he had:&mdash;he learn'd, and was undone!</p>
<p class="i1">Better, apprenticed to an humble trade,</p>
<p>Had he the cassock for the priesthood made,</p>
<p>Or thrown the shuttle, or the saddle shaped,</p>
<p>And all these pangs of feeling souls escaped.</p>
<p class="i1">He once had hope&mdash;hope ardent, lively, light;</p>
<p>His feelings pleasant, and his prospects bright:</p>
<p>Eager of fame, he read, he thought, he wrote,</p>
<p>Weigh'd the Greek page, and added note on note;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>At morn, at evening at his work was he,                        </p>
<p>And dream'd what his Euripides would be.</p>
<p class="i1">Then care began;&mdash;he loved, he woo'd, he wed;</p>
<p>Hope cheer'd him still, and Hymen bless'd his <span class="locked">bed&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A Curate's bed! then came the woful years,</p>
<p>The husband's terrors, and the father's tears;</p>
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310" class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</a>
<p>A wife grown feeble, mourning, pining, vex'd,</p>
<p>With wants and woes&mdash;by daily cares perplex'd;</p>
<p>No more a help, a smiling, soothing aid,</p>
<p>But boding, drooping, sickly, and afraid.</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p class="i1">A kind physician and without a fee,           </p>
<p>Gave his opinion&mdash;"Send her to the sea."</p>
<p>"Alas!" the good man answer'd, "can I send</p>
<p>A friendless woman? Can I find a friend?</p>
<p>No; I must with her, in her need, repair</p>
<p>To that new place; the poor lie <span class="locked">everywhere;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Some priest will pay me for my pious <span class="locked">pains:"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He said, he came, and here he yet remains.</p>
<p class="i1">Behold his dwelling; this poor hut he hires,</p>
<p>Where he from view, though not from want, retires;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Where four fair daughters, and five sorrowing sons,            </p>
<p>Partake his sufferings, and dismiss his duns.</p>
<p>All join their efforts, and in patience learn</p>
<p>To want the comforts they aspire to earn;</p>
<p>For the sick mother something they'd obtain,</p>
<p>To soothe her grief and mitigate her pain;</p>
<p>For the sad father something they'd procure,</p>
<p>To ease the burthen they themselves endure.</p>
<p class="i1">Virtues like these at once delight and press</p>
<p>On the fond father with a proud distress;</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>On all around he looks with care and love,                     </p>
<p>Grieved to behold, but happy to approve.</p>
<p class="i1">Then from his care, his love, his grief he steals,</p>
<p>And by himself an author's pleasure feels;</p>
<p>Each line detains him, he omits not one,</p>
<p>And all the sorrows of his state are <span class="locked">gone.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Alas! ev'n then, in that delicious hour,</p>
<p>He feels his fortune, and laments its power.</p>
<p class="i1">Some tradesman's bill his wandering eyes engage,</p>
<p>Some scrawl for payment, thrust 'twixt page and page;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Some bold, loud rapping at his humble door,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Some surly message he has heard before,                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Awake, alarm, and tell him he is poor.                         </p>
<p class="i1">An angry dealer, vulgar, rich, and proud,</p>
<p>Thinks of his bill, and passing, raps aloud;</p>
<p>The elder daughter meekly makes him <span class="locked">way&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311" class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</a>
<p>"I want my money, and I cannot stay:</p>
<p>My mill is stopp'd; what, Miss! I cannot grind;</p>
<p>Go tell your father he must raise the wind."</p>
<p>Still trembling, troubled, the dejected maid</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Says, "Sir! my father!&mdash;" and then steps afraid:               </p>
<p>Ev'n his hard heart is soften'd, and he hears</p>
<p>Her voice with pity; he respects her tears;</p>
<p>His stubborn features half admit a smile,</p>
<p>And his tone softens&mdash;"Well! I'll wait awhile."</p>
<p class="i1">Pity, a man so good, so mild, so meek,</p>
<p>At such an age, should have his bread to seek;</p>
<p>And all those rude and fierce attacks to dread,</p>
<p>That are more harrowing than the want of bread;</p>
<p>Ah! who shall whisper to that misery peace,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>And say that want and insolence shall cease?                   </p>
<p class="i1">"But why not publish?"&mdash;those who know too well,</p>
<p>Dealers in Greek, are fearful 'twill not sell;</p>
<p>Then he himself is timid, troubled, slow,</p>
<p>Nor likes his labours nor his griefs to show;</p>
<p>The hope of fame may in his heart have place,</p>
<p>But he has dread and horror of disgrace;</p>
<p>Nor has he that confiding, easy way,</p>
<p>That might his learning and himself display;</p>
<p>But to his work he from the world retreats,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>And frets and glories o'er the favourite sheets.               </p>
<p class="i1">But see the man himself; and sure I trace</p>
<p>Signs of new joy exulting in that face</p>
<p>O'er care that sleeps&mdash;we err, or we discern</p>
<p>Life in thy looks&mdash;the reason may we learn?</p>
<p class="i1">"Yes," he replied, "I'm happy, I confess,</p>
<p>To learn that some are pleased with happiness</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Which others feel&mdash;there are who now combine                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>The worthiest natures in the best design,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>To aid the letter'd poor, and soothe such ills as mine:        </p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>We who more keenly feel the world's contempt,                  </p>
<p>And from its miseries are the least exempt;</p>
<p>Now hope shall whisper to the wounded breast,</p>
<p>And grief, in soothing expectation, rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Yes, I am taught that men who think, who feel,</p>
<p>Unite the pains of thoughtful men to heal;</p>
<a name="Page_312" id="Page_312" class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</a>
<p>Not with disdainful pride, whose bounties make</p>
<p>The needy curse the benefits they take;</p>
<p>Not with the idle vanity that knows</p>
<p>Only a selfish joy when it bestows;</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Not with o'erbearing wealth, that, in disdain,                 </p>
<p>Hurls the superfluous bliss at groaning pain;</p>
<p>But these are men who yield such bless'd relief</p>
<p>That with the grievance they destroy the grief;</p>
<p>Their timely aid the needy sufferers find,</p>
<p>Their generous manner soothes the suffering mind;</p>
<p>Theirs is a gracious bounty, form'd to raise</p>
<p>Him whom it aids; their charity is praise;</p>
<p>A common bounty may relieve distress,</p>
<p>But whom the vulgar succour, they oppress;</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>This, though a favour, is an honour too;                       </p>
<p>Though mercy's duty, yet 'tis merit's due:</p>
<p>When our relief from such resources rise,</p>
<p>All painful sense of obligation dies;</p>
<p>And grateful feelings in the bosom wake,</p>
<p>For 'tis their offerings, not their alms, we take.</p>
<p class="i1">Long may these founts of charity remain,</p>
<p>And never shrink but to be fill'd again;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>True! to the author they are now confined,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>To him who gave the treasure of his mind,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><div class="linenum">320</div><p>His time, his health, and thankless found mankind:             </p>
<p>But there is hope that from these founts may flow</p>
<p>A sideway stream, and equal good <span class="locked">bestow&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Good that may reach us, whom the day's distress</p>
<p>Keeps from the fame and perils of the press;</p>
<p>Whom study beckons from the ills of life,</p>
<p>And they from study&mdash;melancholy strife!</p>
<p>Who then can say but bounty now so free,</p>
<p>And so diffused, may find its way to me?</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! I may see my decent table yet</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Cheer'd with the meal that adds not to my debt;                </p>
<p>May talk of those to whom so much we owe,</p>
<p>And guess their names whom yet we may not know;</p>
<p>Bless'd we shall say are those who thus can give,</p>
<p>And next who thus upon the bounty live;</p>
<p>Then shall I close with thanks my humble meal,</p>
<p>And feel so well&mdash;Oh! God! how I shall feel!"</p>

<p class="subtitle3">SECTS AND PROFESSIONS IN RELIGION.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<p>"Sects in Religion?"&mdash;Yes, of every race</p>
<p>We nurse some portion in our favoured place;</p>
<p>Not one warm preacher of one growing sect</p>
<p>Can say our Borough treats him with neglect;</p>
<p>Frequent as fashions they with us appear,</p>
<p>And you might ask, "how think we for the year?"</p>
<p>They come to us as riders in a trade,</p>
<p>And with much art exhibit and persuade.</p>
<p class="i1">Minds are for sects of various kinds decreed,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>As different soils are form'd for diff'rent seed;               </p>
<p>Some, when converted, sigh in sore amaze,</p>
<p>And some are wrapt in joy's ecstatic blaze;</p>
<p>Others again will change to each extreme,</p>
<p>They know not why&mdash;as hurried in a dream;</p>
<p>Unstable they, like water, take all forms,</p>
<p>Are quick and stagnant, have their calms and storms;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>High on the hills, they in the sunbeams glow;                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Then muddily they move debased and slow,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Or cold and frozen rest, and neither rise nor flow.            </p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p class="i1">Yet none the cool and prudent teacher prize;       </p>
<p>On him they dote who wakes their ecstasies;</p>
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315" class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</a>
<p>With passions ready primed such guide they meet,</p>
<p>And warm and kindle with th' imparted heat;</p>
<p>'Tis he who wakes the nameless strong desire,</p>
<p>The melting rapture, and the glowing fire;</p>
<p>'Tis he who pierces deep the tortured breast,</p>
<p>And stirs the terrors, never more to rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Opposed to these we have a prouder kind,</p>
<p>Rash without heat, and without raptures blind;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>These our <i>Glad Tidings</i> unconcern'd peruse,               </p>
<p>Search without awe, and without fear refuse;</p>
<p>The truths, the blessings found in Sacred Writ,</p>
<p>Call forth their spleen, and exercise their wit;</p>
<p>Respect from these nor saints nor martyrs gain;</p>
<p>The zeal they scorn, and they deride the pain;</p>
<p>And take their transient, cool, contemptuous view,</p>
<p>Of that which must be tried, and doubtless&mdash;<i>may be true</i>.</p>
<p class="i1">Friends of our faith we have, whom doubts like these,</p>
<p>And keen remarks, and bold objections please;</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>They grant such doubts have weaker minds oppress'd,             </p>
<p>Till sound conviction gave the troubled rest.</p>
<p class="i1">"But still," they cry, "let none their censures spare;</p>
<p>They but confirm the glorious hopes we share;</p>
<p>From doubt, disdain, derision, scorn, and lies,</p>
<p>With five-fold triumph sacred truth shall rise."</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! I allow, so truth shall stand at last,</p>

<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>The smiling plain and fertile vale o'erlaid,                    </p>
<p>Choked the green sod, and kill'd the springing blade;</p>
<p>That, changed by culture, may in time be seen,</p>
<p>Enrich'd by golden grain, and pasture green;</p>
<p>And these fair acres, rented and enjoy'd,</p>
<p>May those excel by Solway-Moss destroyed<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">Still must have mourn'd the tenant of the day,</p>
<p>For hopes destroy'd and harvests swept away;</p>
<p>To him the gain of future years unknown,</p>
<p>The instant grief and suffering were his own.</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>So must I grieve for many a wounded heart,                      </p>
<p>Chill'd by those doubts which bolder minds impart:</p>
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316" class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</a>
<p>Truth in the end shall shine divinely clear,</p>
<p>But sad the darkness till those times appear;</p>
<p>Contests for truth, as wars for freedom, yield</p>
<p>Glory and joy to those who gain the field;</p>
<p>But still the Christian must in pity sigh</p>
<p>For all who suffer, and uncertain die.</p>
<p class="i1">Here are, who all the Church maintains approve,</p>
<p>But yet the Church herself they will not love;</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>In angry speech, they blame the carnal tie,                     </p>
<p>Which pure Religion lost her spirit by;</p>
<p>What time from prisons, flames, and tortures led,</p>
<p>She slumber'd careless in a royal bed;</p>
<p>To make, they add, the Churches' glory shine.</p>
<p>Should Diocletian reign, not Constantine.</p>
<p class="i1">"In pomp," they cry, "is England's Church array'd;</p>
<p>Her cool reformers wrought like men afraid.</p>
<p>We would have pull'd her gorgeous temples down,</p>
<p>And spurn'd her mitre, and defiled her gown;</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>We would have trodden low both bench and stall,                 </p>
<p>Nor left a tithe remaining, great or small."</p>
<p class="i1">Let us be serious.&mdash;Should such trials come,</p>
<p>Are they themselves prepared for martyrdom?</p>
<p>It seems to us that our reformers knew</p>
<p>Th' important work they undertook to do;</p>
<p>An equal priesthood they were loth to try,</p>
<p>Lest zeal and care should with ambition die;</p>
<p>To them it seem'd that, take the tenth away,</p>
<p>Yet priests must eat, and you must feed or pay:</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Would they indeed, who hold such pay in scorn,                  </p>
<p>Put on the muzzle when they tread the corn?</p>
<p>Would they, all gratis, watch and tend the fold,</p>
<p>Nor take one fleece to keep them from the cold?</p>
<p class="i1">Men are not equal, and 'tis meet and right</p>
<p>That robes and titles our respect excite;</p>
<p>Order requires it; 'tis by vulgar pride</p>
<p>That such regard is censured and denied,</p>
<p>Or by that false enthusiastic zeal,</p>
<p>That thinks the spirit will the priest reveal,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>And show to all men, by their powerful speech,                 </p>
<p>Who are appointed and inspired to teach.</p>
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317" class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</a>
<p>Alas! could we the dangerous rule believe,</p>
<p>Whom for their teacher should the crowd receive?</p>
<p>Since all the varying kinds demand respect,</p>
<p>All press you on to join their chosen sect,</p>
<p>Although but in this single point agreed,</p>
<p>"Desert your churches and adopt our creed."</p>
<p class="i1">We know full well how much our forms offend</p>
<p>The burthen'd Papist and the simple <span class="locked">Friend&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Him who new robes for every service takes,                     </p>
<p>And who in drab and beaver sighs and shakes.</p>
<p>He on the priest, whom hood and band adorn,</p>
<p>Looks with the sleepy eye of silent scorn;</p>
<p>But him I would not for my friend and guide,</p>
<p>Who views such things with spleen, or wears with pride.</p>
<p class="i1">See next our several sects&mdash;but first behold</p>
<p>The Church of Rome, who here is poor and old:</p>
<p>Use not triumphant rail'ry, or, at least,</p>
<p>Let not thy mother be a whore and beast.</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Great was her pride indeed in ancient times;                   </p>
<p>Yet shall we think of nothing but her crimes?</p>
<p>Exalted high above all earthly things,</p>
<p>She placed her foot upon the neck of kings;</p>
<p>But some have deeply since avenged the crown,</p>
<p>And thrown her glory and her honours down;</p>
<p>Nor neck nor ear can she of kings command,</p>

<p>On sacred buildings doom'd in dust to lie;</p>
<p>"On seats," they tell, "where priests 'mid tapers dim</p>

<p>Then, in thy way didst thou thy foe attack,                    </p>
<p>And mad'st thou proud Apollyon turn his back?'</p>
<p class="i1">"Heart-searching things are these, and shake the mind,</p>
<p>Yea, like the rustling of a mighty wind.</p>
<p class="i1">"Thus would I ask:&mdash;'Nay, let me question now,</p>
<p>How sink my sayings in your bosoms? how?</p>
<p>Feel you a quickening? drops the subject deep?</p>

<p>Then, whence this quiet, tell me, I beseech?</p>
<p>One might believe you heard your rector preach,</p>
<p>Or his assistant dreamer;&mdash;Oh! return,</p>
<p>Ye times of burning, when the heart would burn.</p>
<p>Now hearts are ice, and you, my freezing fold,</p>
<p>Have spirits sunk and sad, and bosoms stony-cold,'</p>
<p class="i1">"Oh! now again for those prevailing powers,</p>
<p>Which once began this mighty work of ours;</p>
<div class="linenum">490</div>
<p>When the wide field, God's temple, was the place,              </p>
<p>And birds flew by to catch a breath of grace;</p>
<p>When 'mid his timid friends and threat'ning foes,</p>
<p>Our zealous chief as Paul at Athens rose:</p>
<p>When with infernal spite and knotty clubs</p>
<p>The ill-one arm'd his scoundrels and his scrubs;</p>
<p>And there were flying all around the spot</p>
<p>Brands at the preacher, but they touch'd him not;</p>
<p>Stakes brought to smite him, threaten'd in his cause,</p>
<p>And tongues, attuned to curses, roar'd applause;</p>
<div class="linenum">500</div>
<p>Louder and louder grew his awful tones,                        </p>
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327" class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</a>
<p>Sobbing and sighs were heard, and rueful groans;</p>
<p>Soft women fainted, prouder man express'd</p>
<p>Wonder and wo, and butchers smote the breast;</p>
<p>Eyes wept, ears tingled; stiff'ning on each head,</p>
<p>The hair drew back, and Satan howl'd and fled.</p>
<p class="i1">"In that soft season, when the gentle breeze</p>
<p>Rises all round, and swells by slow degrees;</p>
<p>Till tempests gather, when through all the sky</p>
<p>The thunders rattle, and the lightnings fly;</p>
<div class="linenum">510</div>
<p>When rain in torrents wood and vale deform,                    </p>
<p>And all is horror, hurricane, and storm:</p>
<p>So, when the preacher in that glorious time,</p>
<p>Than clouds more melting, more than storm sublime,</p>
<p>Dropp'd the new word, there came a charm around;</p>
<p>Tremors and terrors rose upon the sound;</p>
<p>The stubborn spirits by his force he broke,</p>
<p>As the fork'd lightning rives the knotted oak.</p>
<p>Fear, hope, dismay, all signs of shame or grace,</p>
<p>Chain'd every foot, or featured every face;</p>
<div class="linenum">520</div>
<p>Then took his sacred trump a louder swell,                     </p>
<p>And now they groan'd they sicken'd, and they fell;</p>
<p>Again he sounded, and we heard the cry</p>
<p>Of the word-wounded, as about to die;</p>
<p>Further and further spread the conquering word,</p>
<p>As loud he cried&mdash;'the battle of the Lord.'</p>
<p>Ev'n those apart who were the sound denied,</p>
<p>Fell down instinctive, and in spirit died.</p>
<p>Nor [stay'd] he yet&mdash;his eye, his frown, his speech,</p>
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328" class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</a>
<p>His very gesture had a power to teach;</p>
<div class="linenum">530</div>
<p>With outstretch'd arms, strong voice and piercing call,        </p>
<p>He won the field, and made the Dagons fall;</p>
<p>And thus in triumph took his glorious way,</p>
<p>Through scenes of horror, terror, and dismay."</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER V.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE ELECTION.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">Yes, our Election's past, and we've been free,</p>
<p>Somewhat as madmen without keepers be;</p>
<p>And such desire of freedom has been shown,</p>
<p>That both the parties wish'd her all their own:</p>
<p>All our free smiths and cobblers in the town</p>
<p>Were loth to lay such pleasant freedom <span class="locked">down&mdash;</span></p>
<p>To put the bludgeon and cockade aside,</p>
<p>And let us pass unhurt and undefied.</p>
<p class="i1">True! you might then your party's sign produce,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>And so escape with only half th' abuse&mdash;                        </p>
<p>With half the danger as you walk'd along,</p>
<p>With rage and threat'ning but from half the throng.</p>
<p>This you might do, and not your fortune mend;</p>
<p>For where you lost a foe, you gain'd a friend;</p>
<p>And, to distress you, vex you, and expose,</p>
<p>Election-friends are worse than any foes;</p>
<p>The party-curse is with the canvass past,</p>
<p>But party-friendship, for your grief, will last.</p>
<p class="i1">Friends of all kinds, the civil and the rude,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Who humbly wish, or boldly dare t' intrude:                     </p>
<a name="Page_331" id="Page_331" class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</a>
<p>These beg or take a liberty to come</p>
<p>(Friends should be free), and make your house their home;</p>
<p>They know that warmly you their cause espouse,</p>
<p>And come to make their boastings and their bows.</p>
<p>You scorn their manners, you their words mistrust;</p>
<p>But you must hear them, and they know you must.</p>
<p class="i1">One plainly sees a friendship firm and true</p>
<p>Between the noble candidate and you;</p>
<p>So humbly begs (and states at large the case),</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>"You'll think of Bobby and the little place."                   </p>
<p class="i1">Stifling his shame by drink, a wretch will come,</p>
<p>And prate your wife and daughter from the room:</p>
<p>In pain you hear him, and at heart despise,</p>
<p>Yet with heroic mind your pangs disguise;</p>
<p>And still in patience to the sot attend,</p>
<p>To show what man can bear to serve a friend.</p>
<p class="i1">One enters hungry&mdash;not to be denied,</p>
<p>And takes his place and jokes&mdash;"We're of a side."</p>
<p>Yet worse, the proser who, upon the strength</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Of his one vote, has tales of three hours' length&mdash;             </p>
<p>This sorry rogue you bear, yet with surprise</p>
<p>Start at his oaths, and sicken at his lies.</p>
<p class="i1">Then comes there one, and tells in friendly way,</p>
<p>What the opponents in their anger say;</p>
<p>All that through life has vex'd you, all abuse,</p>
<p>Will this kind friend in pure regard produce;</p>
<p>And, having through your own offences run,</p>
<p>Adds (as appendage) what your friends have done.</p>
<p class="i1">Has any female cousin made a trip</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>To Gretna-Green, or more vexatious slip?                        </p>
<p>Has your wife's brother, or your uncle's son,</p>
<p>Done aught amiss, or is he thought t' have done?</p>
<p>Is there of all your kindred some who lack</p>
<p>Vision direct, or have a gibbous back?</p>
<p>From your unlucky name may quips and puns</p>
<p>Be made by these upbraiding Goths and Huns?</p>
<p>To some great public character have you</p>
<p>Assign'd the fame to worth and talents due,</p>
<p>Proud of your praise?&mdash;In this, in any case,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Where the brute-spirit may affix disgrace,                      </p>
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332" class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</a>
<p>These friends will smiling bring it, and the while</p>
<p>You silent sit, and practise for a smile.</p>
<p class="i1">Vain of their power, and of their value sure,</p>
<p>They nearly guess the tortures you endure;</p>
<p>Nor spare one pang&mdash;for they perceive your heart</p>
<p>Goes with the cause; you'd die before you'd start;</p>
<p>Do what they may, they're sure you'll not offend</p>
<p>Men who have pledged their honours to your friend.</p>
<p class="i1">Those friends indeed, who start as in a race,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>May love the sport, and laugh at this disgrace;                 </p>
<p>They have in view the glory and the prize,</p>
<p>Nor heed the dirty steps by which they rise:</p>
<p>But we, their poor associates, lose the fame,</p>
<p>Though more than partners in the toil and shame.</p>
<p class="i1">Were this the whole, and did the time produce</p>
<p>But shame and toil, but riot and abuse:</p>
<p>We might be then from serious griefs exempt,</p>
<p>And view the whole with pity and contempt,</p>
<p>Alas! but here the vilest passions rule;</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>It is Seduction's, is Temptation's school:                      </p>
<p>Where vices mingle in the oddest ways,</p>
<p>The grossest slander and the dirtiest praise;</p>
<p>Flattery enough to make the vainest sick,</p>
<p>And clumsy stratagem, and scoundrel trick.</p>
<p>Nay more, your anger and contempt to cause,</p>
<p>These, while they fish for profit, claim applause;</p>
<p>Bribed, bought and bound, they banish shame and fear;</p>
<p>Tell you they're stanch, and have a soul sincere;</p>
<p>Then talk of honour, and, if doubt's express'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Show where it lies, and smite upon the breast.                  </p>
<p class="i1">Among these worthies, some at first declare</p>
<p>For whom they vote; he then has most to spare.</p>
<p>Others hang off&mdash;when coming to the post</p>
<p>Is spurring time, and then he'll spare the most;</p>
<p>While some, demurring, wait, and find at last</p>
<p>The bidding languish, and the market pass'd;</p>
<p>These will affect all bribery to condemn,</p>
<p>And, be it Satan laughs, he laughs at them.</p>
<p class="i1">Some too are pious&mdash;one desired the Lord</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>To teach him where "to drop his little word;                   </p>
<a name="Page_333" id="Page_333" class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</a>
<p>To lend his vote, where it will profit best;</p>
<p>Promotion came not from the east or west;</p>
<p>But as their freedom had promoted some,</p>
<p>He should be glad to know which way 'twould come,</p>
<p>It was a naughty world, and, where to sell</p>
<p>His precious charge, was more than he could tell."</p>
<p class="i1">"But you succeeded?"&mdash;true, at mighty cost;</p>
<p>And our good friend, I fear, will think he's lost.</p>
<p>Inns, horses, chaises, dinners, balls and notes;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>What fill'd their purses, and what drench'd their throats;     </p>
<p>The private pension, and indulgent lease,</p>
<p>Have all been granted to these friends who <span class="locked">fleece&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Friends who will hang like burs upon his coat,</p>
<p>And boundless judge the value of a vote.</p>
<p class="i1">And, though the terrors of the time be pass'd,</p>
<p>There still remain the scatterings of the blast.</p>
<p>The boughs are parted that entwined before,</p>
<p>And ancient harmony exists no more;</p>
<p>The gusts of wrath our peaceful seats deform,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>And sadly flows the sighing of the storm:                      </p>
<p>Those who have gain'd are sorry for the gloom,</p>
<p>But they who lost unwilling peace should come;</p>
<p>There open envy, here suppress'd delight,</p>
<p>Yet live till time shall better thoughts excite,</p>
<p>And so prepare us, by a six-years' truce,</p>
<p>Again for riot, insult, and abuse.</p>
<p class="i1">Our worthy mayor, on the victorious part,</p>
<p>Cries out for peace, and cries with all his heart;</p>
<p>He, civil creature! ever does his best,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>To banish wrath from every voter's breast;                     </p>
<p>"For where," says he, with reason strong and plain,</p>
<p>"Where is the profit? what will anger gain?"</p>
<p>His short stout person he is wont to brace</p>
<p>In good brown broad-cloth, edged with two-inch lace,</p>
<p>When in his seat; and still the coat seems new,</p>
<p>Preserved by common use of seaman's blue.</p>
<p class="i1">He was a fisher from his earliest day,</p>
<p>And placed his nets within the Borough's bay;</p>
<p>Where by his skates, his herrings, and his soles,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>He lived, nor dream'd of corporation-doles<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>;                 </p>
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334" class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</a>
<p>But, toiling, saved and, saving, never ceased</p>
<p>Till he had box'd up twelve score pounds at least.</p>
<p>He knew not money's power, but judged it best</p>
<p>Safe in his trunk to let his treasure rest;</p>
<p>Yet to a friend complain'd: "Sad charge, to keep</p>
<p>So many pounds, and then I cannot sleep."</p>
<p>"Then put it out," replied the friend.&mdash;"What, give</p>
<p>My money up? why, then I could not <span class="locked">live."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Nay, but for interest place it in his hands,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Who'll give you mortgage on his house or lands."&mdash;             </p>
<p>"Oh but," said Daniel, "that's a dangerous plan;</p>
<p>He may be robb'd like any other <span class="locked">man."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Still he is bound, and you may be at rest,</p>
<p>More safe the money than within your chest;</p>
<p>And you'll receive, from all deductions clear,</p>
<p>Five pounds for every hundred, every <span class="locked">year."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"What good in that?" quoth Daniel, "for 'tis plain,</p>
<p>If part I take, there can but part <span class="locked">remain."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"What! you, my friend, so skill'd in gainful things,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Have you to learn what interest money brings?"&mdash;               </p>
<p>"Not so," said Daniel, "perfectly I know,</p>
<p>He's the most interest who has most to <span class="locked">show."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"True! and he'll show the more, the more he lends;</p>
<p>Thus he his weight and consequence extends;</p>
<p>For they who borrow must restore each sum,</p>
<p>And pay for use&mdash;What, Daniel, art thou dumb?"</p>
<p>For much amazed was that good man&mdash;"Indeed!"</p>
<p>Said he, with glad'ning eye, "will money breed?</p>
<p>How have I lived? I grieve, with all my heart,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>For my late knowledge in this precious art:&mdash;                  </p>
<p>Five pounds for every hundred will he give?</p>
<p>And then the hundred?&mdash;&mdash;I begin to <span class="locked">live."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>So he began, and other means he found,</p>
<p>As he went on, to multiply a pound:</p>
<p>Though blind so long to interest, all allow</p>
<p>That no man better understands it now.</p>
<p>Him in our body-corporate we chose,</p>
<p>And, once among us, he above us rose;</p>
<p>Stepping from post to post, he reach'd the chair,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>And there he now reposes&mdash;that's the mayor.                    </p>
<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335" class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</a>
<p class="i1">But 'tis not he, 'tis not the kinder few,</p>
<p>The mild, the good, who can our peace renew;</p>
<p>A peevish humour swells in every eye,</p>
<p>The warm are angry, and the cool are shy;</p>
<p>There is no more the social board at whist.</p>
<p>The good old partners are with scorn dismiss'd;</p>
<p>No more with dog and lantern comes the maid,</p>
<p>To guide the mistress when the rubber's play'd;</p>
<p>Sad shifts are made, lest ribbons blue and green</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Should at one table, at one time be seen.                      </p>
<p>On care and merit none will now rely,</p>
<p>'Tis party sells what party-friends must buy;</p>
<p>The warmest burgess wears a bodger's coat,</p>
<p>And fashion gains less int'rest than a vote;</p>
<p>Uncheck'd, the vintner still his poison vends;</p>
<p>For he too votes, and can command his friends.</p>
<p class="i1">But, this admitted, be it still agreed,</p>
<p>These ill effects from noble cause proceed;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Though like some vile excrescences they be,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>The tree they spring from is a sacred tree,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And its true produce, strength and liberty.                    </p>
<p class="i1">Yet if we could th' attendant ills suppress;</p>
<p>If we could make the sum of mischief less;</p>
<p>If we could warm and angry men persuade</p>
<p>No more man's common comforts to invade;</p>
<p>And that old ease and harmony re-seat</p>
<p>In all our meetings, so in joy to meet:</p>
<p>Much would of glory to the Muse ensue,</p>

<p>I am informed that some explanation is here necessary, though I am
ignorant for what class of my readers it can be required. Some corporate
bodies have actual property, as appears by their receiving rents; and they
obtain money on the admission of members into their society: this they
may lawfully share perhaps. There are, moreover, other doles, of still
greater value, of which it is not necessary for me to explain the nature, or

<p class="semiheader">LETTER VI.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">PROFESSIONS&mdash;LAW.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">"Trades and Professions"&mdash;these are themes the Muse,</p>
<p>Left to her freedom, would forbear to choose;</p>
<p>But to our Borough they in truth belong,</p>
<p>And we, perforce, must take them in our song.</p>
<p class="i1">Be it then known that we can boast of these</p>
<p>In all denominations, ranks, degrees;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>All who our numerous wants through life supply,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Who soothe us sick, attend us when we die,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Or for the dead their various talents try.                     </p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Then have we those who live by secret arts,                     </p>
<p>By hunting fortunes, and by stealing hearts;</p>
<p>Or who by nobler means themselves advance;</p>
<p>Or who subsist by charity and chance.</p>
<p class="i1">Say, of our native heroes shall I boast,</p>
<p>Born in our streets, to thunder on our <span class="locked">coast&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Our Borough-seamen? Could the timid Muse</p>
<p>More patriot-ardour in their breasts infuse;</p>
<p>Or could she paint their merit or their skill,</p>
<p>She wants not love, alacrity, or will;</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>But needless all: that ardour is their own,                     </p>
<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338" class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</a>
<p>And, for their deeds, themselves have made them known.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">Soldiers in arms! Defenders of our soil!       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Who from destruction save us; who from spoil                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Protect the sons of peace who traffic, or who toil:            </p>
<p>Would I could duly praise you; that each deed</p>
<p>Your foes might honour, and your friends might read:</p>
<p>This too is needless; you've imprinted well</p>
<p>Your powers, and told what I should feebly tell.</p>
<p>Beside, a Muse like mine, to satire prone,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Would fail in themes where there is praise alone.               </p>
<p class="i1">&mdash;Law shall I sing, or what to Law belongs?</p>
<p>Alas! there may be danger in such songs;</p>
<p>A foolish rhyme, 'tis said, a trifling thing,</p>
<p>The law found treason, for it touch'd the king.</p>
<p>But kings have mercy in these happy times,</p>
<p>Or surely <i>one</i> had suffer'd for his rhymes;</p>
<p>Our glorious Edwards and our Henrys bold,</p>
<p>So touch'd, had kept the reprobate in hold;</p>
<p>But he escaped&mdash;nor fear, thank Heav'n, have I,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Who love my king, for such offence to die.                      </p>
<p>But I am taught the danger would be much,</p>
<p>If these poor lines should one attorney <span class="locked">touch&mdash;</span></p>
<p>(One of those <i>limbs</i> of law who're always here;</p>
<p>The <i>heads</i> come down to guide them twice a year.)</p>
<p>I might not swing indeed; but he in sport</p>
<p>Would whip a rhymer on from court to court;</p>
<p>Stop him in each, and make him pay for all</p>
<p>The long proceedings in that dreaded <span class="locked">Hall.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Then let my numbers flow discreetly on,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Warn'd by the fate of luckless Coddrington<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>;                 </p>
<p>Lest some <i>attorney</i> (pardon me the name)</p>
<p>Should wound a poor <i>solicitor</i> for fame.</p>
<p class="i1">One man of law in George the Second's reign</p>
<p>Was all our frugal fathers would maintain;</p>
<p>He too was kept for forms; a man of peace,</p>
<p>To frame a contract, or to draw a lease:</p>
<p>He had a clerk, with whom he used to write</p>
<p>All the day long, with whom he drank at night;</p>
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339" class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</a>
<p>Spare was his visage, moderate his bill,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>And he so kind, men doubted of his skill.                       </p>
<p class="i1">Who thinks of this, with some amazement sees,</p>
<p>For one so poor, three flourishing at <span class="locked">ease&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Nay, one in splendour!&mdash;See that mansion tall,</p>
<p>That lofty door, the far-resounding hall;</p>
<p>Well-furnish'd rooms, plate shining on the board,</p>
<p>Gay liveried lads, and cellar proudly stored:</p>
<p>Then say how comes it that such fortunes crown</p>
<p>These sons of strife, these terrors of the town?</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! that small office! there th' incautious guest</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Goes blindfold in, and that maintains the rest;                 </p>
<p>There in his web th' observant spider lies,</p>
<p>And peers about for fat intruding flies;</p>
<p>Doubtful at first, he hears the distant hum,</p>
<p>And feels them flutt'ring as they nearer come.</p>
<p>They buzz and blink, and doubtfully they tread</p>
<p>On the strong birdlime of the utmost thread;</p>
<p>But, when they're once entangled by the gin,</p>
<p>With what an eager clasp he draws them in;</p>
<p>Nor shall they 'scape till after long delay,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>And all that sweetens life is drawn away.                       </p>
<p class="i1">"Nay, this," you cry, "is common-place, the tale</p>
<p>Of petty tradesmen o'er their evening-ale.</p>
<p>There are who, living by the legal pen,</p>
<p>Are held in honour&mdash;'honourable men.'"</p>
<p class="i1">Doubtless&mdash;there are, who hold manorial courts,</p>
<p>Or whom the trust of powerful friends supports;</p>
<p>Or who, by labouring through a length of time,</p>
<p>Have pick'd their way, unsullied by a crime.</p>
<p>These are the few&mdash;in this, in every place,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Fix the litigious rupture-stirring race:                        </p>
<p>Who to contention as to trade are led,</p>
<p>To whom dispute and strife are bliss and bread.</p>
<p class="i1">There is a doubtful pauper, and we think</p>
<p>'Tis with us to give him meat and drink;</p>
<p>There is a child, and 'tis not mighty clear</p>
<p>Whether the mother lived with us a year;</p>
<p>A road's indicted, and our seniors doubt</p>
<p>If in our proper boundary or without:</p>
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340" class="pagenum">[Pg 340]</a>
<p>But what says our attorney? He our friend</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Tells us 'tis just and manly to contend.                       </p>
<p class="i1">"What! to a neighbouring parish yield your cause,</p>
<p>While you have money, and the nation laws?</p>
<p>What! lose without a trial, that which tried,</p>
<p>May&mdash;nay it must&mdash;be given on our side?</p>
<p>All men of spirit would contend; such men</p>
<p>Than lose a pound would rather hazard ten.</p>
<p>What! be imposed on? No! a British soul</p>
<p>Despises imposition, hates control;</p>
<p>The law is open; let them, if they dare,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Support their cause; the Borough need not spare.               </p>
<p>All I advise is vigour and good-will:</p>
<p>Is it agreed then?&mdash;Shall I file a bill?"</p>
<p class="i1">The trader, grazier, merchant, priest, and all</p>
<p>Whose sons aspiring to [professions'] call,</p>
<p>Choose from their lads some bold and subtle boy,</p>
<p>And judge him fitted for this grave employ.</p>
<p>Him a keen old practitioner admits,</p>
<p>To write five years and exercise his wits:</p>
<p>The youth has heard&mdash;it is in fact his <span class="locked">creed&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Mankind dispute, that lawyers may be fee'd:                    </p>
<p>Jails, bailiffs, writs, all terms and threats of law,</p>
<p>Grow now familiar as once top and taw;</p>
<p>Rage, hatred, fear, the mind's severer ills,</p>
<p>All bring employment, all augment his bills;</p>
<p>As feels the surgeon for the mangled limb,</p>
<p>The mangled mind is but a job for him;</p>
<p>Thus taught to think, these legal reasoners draw</p>
<p>Morals and maxims from their views of law;</p>
<p>They cease to judge by precepts taught in schools,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>By man's plain sense, or by religious rules;                   </p>
<p>No! nor by law itself, in truth discern'd,</p>
<p>But as its statutes may be warp'd and turn'd.</p>
<p>How they should judge of man, his word and deed,</p>
<p>They in their books and not their bosoms read:</p>
<p>Of some good act you speak with just applause,</p>
<p>"No! no!" says he, "'twould be a losing cause."</p>
<p>Blame you some tyrant's deed?&mdash;he answers, "Nay,</p>
<p>He'll get a verdict; heed you what you say."</p>
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341" class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</a>
<p>Thus, to conclusions from examples led,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>The heart resigns all judgment to the head;                    </p>
<p>Law, law alone, for ever kept in view,</p>
<p>His measures guides, and rules his conscience too;</p>
<p>Of ten commandments, he confesses three</p>
<p>Are yet in force, and tells you which they be,</p>
<p>As law instructs him, thus: "Your neighbour's wife</p>
<p>You must not take, his chattels, nor his life;</p>
<p>Break these decrees, for damage you must pay;</p>
<p>These you must reverence, and the rest&mdash;you may."</p>
<p class="i1">Law was design'd to keep a state in peace;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>To punish robbery, that wrong might cease;                     </p>
<p>To be impregnable&mdash;a constant fort,</p>
<p>To which the weak and injured might resort.</p>
<p>But these perverted minds its force employ,</p>
<p>Not to protect mankind, but to annoy;</p>
<p>And, long as ammunition can be found,</p>
<p>Its lightning flashes and its thunders sound.</p>
<p class="i1">Or, law with lawyers is an ample still,</p>
<p>Wrought by the passions' heat with chymic sill;</p>
<p>While the fire burns, the gains are quickly made,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>And freely flow the profits of the trade;                      </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Nay, when the fierceness fails, these artists blow             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>The dying fire, and make the embers glow,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>As long as they can make the smaller profits flow;             </p>
<p>At length the process of itself will stop,</p>
<p>When they perceive they've drawn out every drop.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, I repeat, there are, who nobly strive</p>
<p>To keep the sense of moral worth alive:</p>
<p>Men who would starve, ere meanly deign to live</p>
<p>On what deception and chican'ry give;</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>And these at length succeed: they have their strife,           </p>
<p>Their apprehensions, stops, and rubs in life;</p>
<p>But honour, application, care, and skill,</p>
<p>Shall bend opposing fortune to their will.</p>
<p class="i1">Of such is Archer, he who keeps in awe</p>
<p>Contending parties by his threats of law.</p>
<p>He, roughly honest, has been long a guide</p>
<p>In Borough-business, on the conquering side;</p>
<p>And seen so much of both sides, and so long,</p>
<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342" class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</a>
<p>He thinks the bias of man's mind goes wrong.</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Thus, though he's friendly, he is still severe,                </p>
<p>Surly though kind, suspiciously sincere:</p>
<p>So much he's seen of baseness in the mind,</p>
<p>That, while a friend to man, he scorns mankind;</p>
<p>He knows the human heart, and sees with dread,</p>
<p>By slight temptation, how the strong are led;</p>
<p>He knows how interest can asunder rend</p>
<p>The bond of parent, master, guardian, friend,</p>
<p>To form a new and a degrading tie</p>
<p>'Twixt needy vice and tempting villany.</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Sound in himself, yet, when such flaws appear,                 </p>
<p>He doubts of all, and learns that self to fear:</p>
<p>For, where so dark the moral view is grown,</p>
<p>A timid conscience trembles for her own;</p>
<p>The pitchy taint of general vice is such</p>
<p>As daubs the fancy, and you dread the touch.</p>
<p class="i1">Far unlike him was one in former times,</p>
<p>Famed for the spoil he gather'd by his crimes;</p>
<p>Who, while his brethren nibbling held their prey,</p>
<p>He like an eagle seized and bore the whole away.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p class="i1">Swallow, a poor attorney, brought his boy        </p>
<p>Up at his desk, and gave him his employ;</p>
<p>He would have bound him to an honest trade,</p>
<p>Could preparations have been duly made.</p>
<p>The clerkship ended, both the sire and son</p>
<p>Together did what business could be done;</p>
<p>Sometimes they'd luck to stir up small disputes</p>
<p>Among their friends, and raise them into suits.</p>
<p>Though close and hard, the father was content</p>
<p>With this resource, now old and indolent;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>But his young Swallow, gaping and alive                        </p>
<p>To fiercer feelings, was resolved to <span class="locked">thrive:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Father," he said, "but little can they win</p>
<p>Who hunt in couples, where the game is thin;</p>
<p>Let's part in peace, and each pursue his gain</p>
<p>Where it may start&mdash;our love may yet remain."</p>
<p>The parent growl'd, he couldn't think that love</p>
<p>Made the young cockatrice his den remove;</p>
<p>But, taught by habit, he the truth suppress'd,</p>
<a name="Page_343" id="Page_343" class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</a>
<p>Forced a frank look, and said he "thought it best."</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Not long they'd parted ere dispute arose;                      </p>
<p>The game they hunted quickly made them foes.</p>
<p>Some house the father by his art had won</p>
<p>Seem'd a fit cause of contest to the son:</p>
<p>Who raised a claimant, and then found a way</p>
<p>By a stanch witness to secure his prey.</p>
<p>The people cursed him, but in times of need</p>
<p>Trusted in one so certain to succeed:</p>
<p>By law's dark by-ways he had stored his mind</p>
<p>With wicked knowledge, how to cheat mankind.</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Few are the freeholds in our ancient town;                     </p>
<p>A copy-right from heir to heir came down.</p>
<p>From whence some heat arose, when there was doubt</p>
<p>In point of heirship; but the fire went out,</p>
<p>Till our attorney had the art to raise</p>
<p>The dying spark, and blow it to a blaze.</p>
<p>For this he now began his friends to treat;</p>
<p>His way to starve them was to make them eat,</p>
<p>And drink oblivious draughts&mdash;to his applause</p>
<p>It must be said, he never starved a cause;</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>He'd roast and boil'd upon his board&mdash;the boast                </p>
<p>Of half his victims was his boil'd and <span class="locked">roast&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And these at every hour: he seldom took</p>
<p>Aside his client, till he'd praised his cook;</p>
<p>Nor to an office led him, there in pain</p>
<p>To give his story and go out again,</p>
<p>But first the brandy and the chine were seen.</p>
<p>And then the business came by starts between.</p>
<p class="i1">"Well, if 'tis so, the house to you belongs;</p>
<p>But have you money to redress these wrongs?</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Nay, look not sad, my friend; if you're correct,               </p>
<p>You'll find the friendship that you'd not expect."</p>
<p class="i1">If right the man, the house was Swallow's own;</p>
<p>If wrong, his kindness and good-will were shown.</p>
<p>"Rogue!" "Villain!" "Scoundrel!" cried the losers all;</p>
<p>He let them cry, for what would that recall?</p>
<p>At length he left us, took a village seat,</p>
<p>And like a vulture look'd abroad for meat;</p>
<p>The Borough-booty, give it all its praise,</p>
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344" class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</a>
<p>Had only served the appetite to raise;</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>But, if from simple heirs he drew their land,                  </p>
<p>He might a noble feast at will command;</p>
<p>Still he proceeded by his former rules,</p>
<p>His bait their pleasures, when he fish'd for <span class="locked">fools;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Flagons and haunches on his board were placed,</p>
<p>And subtle avarice look'd like thoughtless waste.</p>
<p>Most of his friends, though youth from him had fled,</p>
<p>Were young, were minors, of their sires in dread;</p>
<p>Or those whom widow'd mothers kept in bounds,</p>
<p>And check'd their generous rage for steeds and hounds;</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>Or such as travell'd 'cross the land to view                   </p>
<p>A Christian's conflict with a boxing Jew.</p>
<p>Some too had run upon Newmarket heath</p>
<p>With so much speed that they were out of breath;</p>
<p>Others had tasted claret, till they now</p>
<p>To humbler port would turn, and knew not how.</p>
<p>All these for favours would to Swallow run,</p>
<p>Who never sought their thanks for all he'd done;</p>
<p>He kindly took them by the hand, then bow'd</p>
<p>Politely low, and thus his love <span class="locked">avow'd&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>(For he'd a way that many judged polite;                       </p>
<p>A cunning dog, he'd fawn before he'd bite)<span class="locked">:&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Observe, my friends, the frailty of our race</p>
<p>When age unmans us&mdash;let me state a case:</p>
<p>There's our friend Rupert; we shall soon redress</p>
<p>His present evil&mdash;drink to our <span class="locked">success&mdash;</span></p>
<p>I flatter not, but did you ever see</p>
<p>Limbs better turn'd? a prettier boy than he?</p>
<p>His senses all acute, his passions such</p>
<p>As nature gave&mdash;she never does too much;</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>His the bold wish the cup of joy to drain,                     </p>
<p>And strength to bear it without qualm or pain.</p>
<p class="i1">"Now view his father as he dozing lies,</p>
<p>Whose senses wake not when he opes his eyes;</p>
<p>Who slips and shuffles when he means to walk,</p>
<p>And lisps and gabbles if he tries to talk;</p>
<p>Feeling he's none: he could as soon destroy</p>
<p>The earth itself, as aught it holds enjoy;</p>
<p>A nurse attends him to lay straight his limbs,</p>
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345" class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</a>
<p>Present his gruel, and respect his whims.</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Now, shall this dotard from our hero hold                      </p>
<p>His lands and lordships? Shall he hide his gold?</p>
<p>That which he cannot use, and dare not show,</p>
<p>And will not give&mdash;why longer should he owe?</p>
<p>Yet, 'twould be murder should we snap the locks,</p>
<p>And take the thing he worships from the box;</p>
<p>So let him dote and dream: but, till he die,</p>
<p>Shall not our generous heir receive supply?</p>
<p>For ever sitting on the river's brink,</p>
<p>And ever thirsty, shall he fear to drink?</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>The means are simple: let him only wish,                       </p>
<p>Then say he's willing, and I'll fill his dish."</p>
<p class="i1">They all applauded, and not least the boy,</p>
<p>Who now replied, "It fill'd his heart with joy</p>
<p>To find he needed not deliv'rance crave</p>
<p>Of death, or wish the justice in the grave;</p>
<p>Who, while he spent, would every art retain,</p>
<p>Of luring home the scatter'd gold again;</p>
<p>Just as a fountain gaily spirts and plays</p>
<p>With what returns in still and secret ways."</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p class="i1">Short was the dream of bliss; he quickly found,     </p>
<p>His father's acres all were Swallow's ground.</p>
<p>Yet to those arts would other heroes lend</p>
<p>A willing ear, and Swallow was their friend;</p>
<p>Ever successful, some began to think</p>
<p>That Satan help'd him to his pen and ink;</p>
<p>And shrewd suspicions ran about the place,</p>
<p>"There was a compact"&mdash;I must leave the case.</p>
<p>But of the parties, had the fiend been one,</p>
<p>The business could not have been speedier done.</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Still, when a man has angled day and night,                    </p>
<p>The silliest gudgeons will refuse to bite:</p>
<p>So Swallow tried no more; but if they came</p>
<p>To seek his friendship, that remain'd the same.</p>
<p>Thus he retired in peace, and some would say,</p>
<p>He balk'd his partner, and had learn'd to pray.</p>
<p>To this some zealots lent an ear, and sought</p>
<p>How Swallow felt, then said "a change is wrought."</p>
<p>'Twas true there wanted all the signs of grace,</p>
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346" class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</a>
<p>But there were strong professions in their place;</p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>Then, too, the less that men from him expect,                  </p>
<p>The more the praise to the converting sect;</p>
<p>He had not yet subscribed to all their creed,</p>
<p>Nor own'd a call; but he confess'd the need.</p>
<p>His acquiescent speech, his gracious look,</p>
<p>That pure attention, when the brethren spoke,</p>
<p>Was all contrition,&mdash;he had felt the wound,</p>
<p>And with confession would again be sound.</p>
<p class="i1">True, Swallow's board had still the sumptuous treat;</p>
<p>But could they blame? the warmest zealots eat.</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>He drank&mdash;'twas needful his poor nerves to brace;              </p>
<p>He swore&mdash;'twas habit; he was grieved&mdash;'twas grace.</p>
<p>What could they do a new-born zeal to nurse?</p>
<p>"His wealth's undoubted&mdash;let him hold our purse;</p>
<p>He'll add his bounty, and the house we'll raise</p>
<p>Hard by the church, and gather all her strays;</p>
<p>We'll watch her sinners as they home retire,</p>
<p>And pluck the brands from the devouring fire."</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! such speech was but an empty boast;</p>
<p>The good men reckon'd, but without their host;</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>Swallow, delighted, took the trusted store,                    </p>
<p>And own'd the sum: they did not ask for more,</p>
<p>Till more was needed; when they call'd for <span class="locked">aid&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And had it?&mdash;No, their agent was afraid;</p>
<p>"Could he but know to whom he should refund,</p>
<p>He would most gladly&mdash;nay, he'd go beyond;</p>
<p>But, when such numbers claim'd, when some were gone,</p>
<p>And others going&mdash;he must hold it on;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>The Lord would help them,"&mdash;Loud their anger grew,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And while they threat'ning from his door withdrew,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>He bow'd politely low, and bade them all adieu.                </p>
<p class="i1">But lives the man by whom such deeds are done?</p>
<p>Yes, many such&mdash;but Swallow's race is run;</p>
<p>His name is lost;&mdash;for, though his sons have name,</p>
<p>It is not his, they all escape the shame;</p>
<p>Nor is there vestige now of all he had,</p>
<p>His means are wasted, for his heir was mad.</p>
<p>Still we of Swallow as a monster speak,</p>
<p>A hard, bad man, who prey'd upon the weak.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">PROFESSIONS&mdash;PHYSIC.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>Next, to a graver tribe we turn our view,</p>
<p>And yield the praise to worth and science due;</p>
<p>But this with serious words and sober style,</p>
<p>For these are friends with whom we seldom smile:</p>
<p>Helpers of men<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they're call'd, and we confess</p>
<p>Theirs the deep study, theirs the lucky guess.</p>
<p>We own that numbers join with care and skill</p>
<p>A temperate judgment, a devoted will:</p>
<p>Men who suppress their feelings, but who feel</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>The painful symptoms they delight to heal;                      </p>
<p>Patient in all their trials, they sustain</p>
<p>The starts of passion, the reproach of pain;</p>
<p>With hearts affected, but with looks serene,</p>
<p>Intent they wait through all the solemn scene;</p>
<p>Glad, if a hope should rise from nature's strife,</p>
<p>To aid their skill and save the lingering life.</p>
<p>But this must virtue's generous effort be,</p>
<p>And spring from nobler motives than a fee:</p>
<p>To the physicians of the soul, and these,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Turn the distress'd for safety, hope, and ease.                 </p>
<a name="Page_349" id="Page_349" class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</a>
<p class="i1">But as physicians of that nobler kind</p>
<p>Have their warm zealots, and their sectaries blind;</p>
<p>So among these for knowledge most renown'd,</p>
<p>Are dreamers strange, and stubborn bigots found.</p>
<p>Some, too, admitted to this honour'd name,</p>
<p>Have, without learning, found a way to fame;</p>
<p>And some by learning:&mdash;young physicians write,</p>
<p>To set their merit in the fairest light;</p>
<p>With them a treatise is a bait that draws</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Approving voices; 'tis to gain applause,                        </p>
<p>And to exalt them in the public view,</p>
<p>More than a life of worthy toil could do.</p>
<p>When 'tis proposed to make the man renown'd,</p>
<p>In every age convenient doubts abound;</p>
<p>Convenient themes in every period start,</p>
<p>Which he may treat with all the pomp of art;</p>
<p>Curious conjectures he may always make,</p>
<p>And either side of dubious questions take.</p>
<p>He may a system broach, or, if he please,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Start new opinions of an old disease;                           </p>
<p>Or may some simple in the woodland trace,</p>
<p>And be its patron, till it runs its race;</p>
<p>As rustic damsels from their woods are won,</p>
<p>And live in splendour till their race be run;</p>
<p>It weighs not much on what their powers be shown,</p>
<p>When all his purpose is to make them known.</p>
<p class="i1">To show the world what long experience gains,</p>
<p>Requires not courage, though it calls for pains;</p>
<p>But, at life's outset to inform mankind,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Is a bold effort of a valiant mind.                             </p>
<p class="i1">The great good man, for noblest cause, displays</p>
<p>What many labours taught, and many days;</p>
<p>These sound instruction from experience give,</p>
<p>The others show us how they mean to live;</p>
<p>That they have genius, and they hope mankind</p>
<p>Will to its efforts be no longer blind.</p>
<p class="i1">There are, beside, whom powerful friends advance,</p>
<p>Whom fashion favours, person, patrons, chance;</p>
<p>And merit sighs to see a fortune made</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>By daring rashness or by dull parade.                           </p>
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350" class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</a>
<p class="i1">But these are trifling evils; there is one</p>
<p>Which walks uncheck'd, and triumphs in the sun:</p>
<p>There was a time, when we beheld the quack,</p>
<p>On public stage, the licensed trade attack;</p>
<p>He made his labour'd speech with poor parade;</p>
<p>And then a laughing zany lent him aid.</p>
<p>Smiling we pass'd him, but we felt the while</p>
<p>Pity so much, that soon we ceased to smile;</p>
<p>Assured that fluent speech and flow'ry vest</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Disguised the troubles of a man distress'd.                     </p>
<p class="i1">But now our quacks are gamesters, and they play</p>
<p>With craft and skill to ruin and betray;</p>
<p>With monstrous promise they delude the mind,</p>
<p>And thrive on all that tortures human-kind.</p>
<p class="i1">Void of all honour, avaricious, rash,</p>
<p>The daring tribe compound their boasted <span class="locked">trash&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Tincture or syrup, lotion, drop or pill;</p>
<p>All tempt the sick to trust the lying bill;</p>
<p>And twenty names of cobblers turn'd to squires,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Aid the bold language of these blushless liars.                 </p>
<p>There are among them those who cannot read,</p>
<p>And yet they'll buy a patent, and succeed;</p>
<p>Will dare to promise dying sufferers <span class="locked">aid,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>For who, when dead, can threaten or upbraid?</p>
<p>With cruel avarice still they recommend</p>
<p>More draughts, more syrup, to the journey's end:</p>
<p>"I feel it not;"&mdash;"Then take it every <span class="locked">hour."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"It makes me worse;"&mdash;"Why, then it shows its <span class="locked">power."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"I fear to die;"&mdash;"Let not your spirits sink,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>You're always safe, while you believe and drink."               </p>
<p class="i1">How strange to add, in this nefarious trade,</p>
<p>That men of parts are dupes by dunces made:</p>
<p>That creatures nature meant should clean our streets</p>
<p>Have purchased lands and mansions, parks and seats;</p>
<p>Wretches with conscience so obtuse, they leave</p>
<p>Their untaught sons their parents to deceive;</p>
<p>And, when they're laid upon their dying-bed,</p>
<p>No thought of murder comes into their head,</p>
<p>Nor one revengeful ghost to them appears,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>To fill the soul with penitential fears.                       </p>
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351" class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</a>
<p class="i1">Yet not the whole of this imposing train</p>
<p>Their gardens, seats, and carriages obtain;</p>
<p>Chiefly, indeed, they to the robbers fall,</p>
<p>Who are most fitted to disgrace them all.</p>
<p>But there is hazard&mdash;patents must be bought,</p>
<p>Venders and puffers for the poison sought;</p>
<p>And then in many a paper through the year</p>
<p>Must cures and cases, oaths and proofs appear;</p>
<p>Men snatch'd from graves, as they were dropping in,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Their lungs cough'd up, their bones pierced through their skin;</p>
<p>Their liver all one scirrhus, and the frame</p>
<p>Poison'd with evils which they dare not name;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Men who spent all upon physicians' fees,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Who never slept, nor had a moment's ease,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Are now as roaches sound, and all as brisk as bees.            </p>
<p class="i1">If the sick gudgeons to the bait attend,</p>
<p>And come in shoals, the angler gains his end;</p>
<p>But, should the advertising cash be spent,</p>
<p>Ere yet the town has due attention lent,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Then bursts the bubble, and the hungry cheat                   </p>
<p>Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat:</p>
<p>It is a lottery, and he shares perhaps</p>
<p>The rich man's feast, or begs the pauper's scraps.</p>
<p class="i1">From powerful causes spring th' empiric's gains,</p>
<p>Man's love of life, his weakness, and his pains;</p>
<p>These first induce him the vile trash to try,</p>
<p>Then lend his name, that other men may buy.</p>
<p>This love of life, which in our nature rules,</p>
<p>To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Then pain compels th' impatient soul to seize                  </p>
<p>On promised hopes of instantaneous ease;</p>
<p>And weakness too with every wish complies,</p>
<p>Worn out and won by importunities.</p>
<p class="i1">Troubled with something in your bile or blood,</p>
<p>You think your doctor does you little good;</p>
<p>And, grown impatient, you require in haste</p>
<p>The nervous cordial, nor dislike the taste;</p>
<p>It comforts, heals, and strengthens; nay, you think</p>
<p>It makes you better every time you drink;</p>
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352" class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</a>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>"Then lend your name"&mdash;you're loth, but yet confess            </p>
<p>Its powers are great, and so you acquiesce.</p>
<p>Yet, think a moment, ere your name you lend,</p>
<p>With whose 'tis placed, and what you recommend;</p>
<p>Who tipples brandy will some comfort feel,</p>
<p>But will he to the med'cine set his seal?</p>
<p>Wait, and you'll find the cordial you admire</p>
<p>Has added fuel to your fever's fire.</p>
<p>Say, should a robber chance your purse to spare,</p>
<p>Would you the honour of the man declare?</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Would you assist his purpose? swell his crime?                 </p>
<p>Besides, he might not spare a second time.</p>
<p class="i1">Compassion sometimes sets the fatal sign,</p>
<p>The man was poor, and humbly begg'd a line;</p>
<p>Else how should noble names and titles back</p>
<p>The spreading praise of some advent'rous quack?</p>
<p>But he the moment watches, and entreats</p>
<p>Your honour's name&mdash;your honour joins the cheats;</p>
<p>You judged the med'cine harmless, and you lent</p>
<p>What help you could, and with the best intent;</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>But can it please you, thus to league with all                 </p>
<p>Whom he can beg or bribe to swell the scrawl?</p>
<p>Would you these wrappers with your name adorn,</p>
<p>Which hold the poison for the yet unborn?</p>
<p class="i1">No class escapes them&mdash;from the poor man's pay</p>
<p>The nostrum takes no trifling part away;</p>
<p>See! those square patent bottles from the shop,</p>
<p>Now decoration to the cupboard's top;</p>
<p>And there a favourite hoard you'll find within,</p>
<p>Companions meet! the julep and the gin.</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p class="i1">Time too with cash is wasted; 'tis the fate       </p>
<p>Of real helpers to be call'd too late;</p>
<p>This find the sick, when (time and patience gone)</p>
<p>Death with a tenfold terror hurries on.</p>
<p class="i1">Suppose the case surpasses human skill,</p>
<p>There comes a quack to flatter weakness still;</p>
<p>What greater evil can a flatterer do,</p>
<p>Than from himself to take the sufferer's view?</p>
<p>To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers,</p>
<p>And rob a sinner of his dying hours?</p>
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353" class="pagenum">[Pg 353]</a>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Yet this they, dare and craving to the last,                   </p>
<p>In hope's strong bondage hold their victim fast:</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>For soul or body no concern have they,                         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>All their inquiry, "Can the patient pay?                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And will he swallow draughts until his dying day?"             </p>
<p class="i1">Observe what ills to nervous females flow,</p>
<p>When the heart flutters, and the pulse is low;</p>
<p>If once induced these cordial sips to try,</p>
<p>All feel the ease, and few the danger fly;</p>
<p>For, while obtain'd, of drams they've all the force,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And when denied, then drams are the resource.                  </p>
<p class="i1">Nor these the only evils&mdash;there are those</p>
<p>Who for the troubled mind prepare repose;</p>
<p>They write: the young are tenderly address'd,</p>
<p>Much danger hinted, much concern express'd;</p>
<p>They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take,</p>
<p>Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake;</p>
<p>Still, if the youthful patient will but trust</p>
<p>In one so kind, so pitiful, and just;</p>
<p>If he will take the tonic all the time,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And hold but moderate intercourse with crime:                  </p>
<p>The sage will gravely give his honest word,</p>
<p>That strength and spirits shall be both restored;</p>
<p>In plainer English&mdash;if you mean to sin,</p>
<p>Fly to the drops, and instantly begin.</p>
<p class="i1">Who would not lend a sympathizing sigh,</p>
<p>To hear yon infant's pity-moving cry?</p>
<p>That feeble sob, unlike the new-born note,</p>
<p>Which came with vigour from the op'ning throat;</p>
<p>When air and light first rush'd on lungs and eyes,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>And there was life and spirit in the cries;                    </p>
<p>Now an abortive, faint attempt to weep</p>
<p>Is all we hear; sensation is asleep.</p>
<p>The boy was healthy, and at first express'd</p>
<p>His feelings loudly, when he fail'd to rest;</p>
<p>When cramm'd with food, and tighten'd every limb,</p>
<p>To cry aloud, was what pertain'd to him;</p>
<p>Then the good nurse, (who, had she borne a brain,</p>
<p>Had sought the cause that made her babe complain,)</p>
<p>Has all her efforts, loving soul! applied,</p>
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354" class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</a>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>To set the cry, and not the cause, aside;                      </p>
<p>She gave her powerful sweet without remorse,</p>
<p><i>The sleeping cordial</i>&mdash;she had tried its force,</p>
<p>Repeating oft; the infant, freed from pain,</p>
<p>Rejected food, but took the dose again,</p>
<p>Sinking to sleep; while she her joy express'd,</p>
<p>That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest:</p>
<p>Soon may she spare her cordial; not a doubt</p>
<p>Remains but quickly he will rest without.</p>
<p class="i1">This moves our grief and pity, and we sigh</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>To think what numbers from these causes die;                   </p>
<p>But what contempt and anger should we show,</p>
<p>Did we the lives of these impostors know!</p>
<p class="i1">Ere for the world's I left the cares of school,</p>
<p>One I remember who assumed the fool:</p>
<p>A part well suited&mdash;when the idler boys</p>
<p>Would shout around him, and he loved the noise;</p>
<p>They call'd him Neddy;&mdash;Neddy had the art</p>
<p>To play with skill his ignominious part;</p>
<p>When he his trifles would for sale display,</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>And act the mimic for a schoolboy's pay.                       </p>
<p>For many years he plied his humble trade,</p>
<p>And used his tricks and talents to persuade;</p>
<p>The fellow barely read, but chanced to look</p>
<p>Among the fragments of a tatter'd book,</p>
<p>Where, after many efforts made to spell</p>
<p>One puzzling word, he found it <i>oxymel</i>:</p>
<p>A potent thing, 'twas said, to cure the ills</p>
<p>Of ailing lungs&mdash;the <i>oxymel of squills</i>.</p>
<p>Squills he procured, but found the bitter strong,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>And most unpleasant; none would take it long;                  </p>
<p>But the pure acid and the sweet would make</p>
<p>A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take.</p>
<p class="i1">There was a fellow near, an artful knave,</p>
<p>Who knew the plan, and much assistance gave;</p>
<p>He wrote the puffs, and every talent plied</p>
<p>To make it sell: it sold, and then he died.</p>
<p class="i1">Now all the profit fell to Ned's control,</p>
<p>And Pride and Avarice quarrell'd for his soul;</p>
<p>When mighty profits by the trash were made,</p>
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355" class="pagenum">[Pg 355]</a>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Pride built a palace, Avarice groan'd and paid;                </p>
<p>Pride placed the signs of grandeur all about,</p>
<p>And Avarice barr'd his friends and children out.</p>
<p class="i1">Now see him doctor! yes, the idle fool,</p>
<p>The butt, the robber of the lads at school;</p>
<p>Who then knew nothing, nothing since acquired,</p>
<p>Became a doctor, honour'd and admired;</p>
<p>His dress, his frown, his dignity were such,</p>
<p>Some who had known him thought his knowledge much;</p>
<p>Nay, men of skill, of apprehension quick,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>Spite of their knowledge, trusted him when sick.               </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER VIII.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">TRADES.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Of manufactures, trade, inventions rare,</p>
<p>Steam-towers and looms, you'd know our Borough's <span class="locked">share&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Tis small: we boast not these rich subjects here,</p>
<p>Who hazard thrice ten thousand pounds a year,</p>
<p>We've no huge buildings, where incessant noise</p>
<p>Is made by springs and spindles, girls and boys;</p>
<p>Where, 'mid such thundering sounds, the maiden's song</p>
<p>Is "Harmony in Uproar"<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> all day long.</p>
<p class="i1">Still, common minds with us, in common trade,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Have gain'd more wealth than ever student made;                 </p>
<p>And yet a merchant, when he gives his son</p>
<p>His college-learning, thinks his duty done;</p>
<p>A way to wealth he leaves his boy to find,</p>
<p>Just when he's made for the discovery blind.</p>
<p class="i1">Jones and his wife perceived their elder boy</p>
<p>Took to his learning, and it gave them joy;</p>
<p>This they encouraged, and were bless'd to see</p>
<p>Their son a Fellow with a high degree;</p>
<p>A living fell, he married, and his sire</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Declared 'twas all a father could require;                      </p>
<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358" class="pagenum">[Pg 358]</a>
<p>Children then bless'd them, and when letters came,</p>
<p>The parents proudly told each grandchild's name.</p>
<p class="i1">Meantime the sons at home in trade were placed,</p>
<p>Money their object&mdash;just the father's taste;</p>
<p>Saving he lived and long, and when he died,</p>
<p>He gave them all his fortune to divide.</p>
<p class="i1">"Martin," said he, "at vast expense was taught;</p>
<p>He gain'd his wish, and has the ease he sought."</p>
<p class="i1">Thus the good priest (the Christian-scholar!) finds</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>What estimate is made by vulgar minds;                          </p>
<p>He sees his brothers, who had every gift</p>
<p>Of thriving, now assisted in their thrift;</p>
<p>While he whom learning, habits, all prevent,</p>
<p>Is largely mulct for each impediment.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, let us own that trade has much of chance:</p>
<p>Not all the careful by their care advance;</p>
<p>With the same parts and prospects, one a seat</p>
<p>Builds for himself; one finds it in the Fleet.</p>
<p>Then, to the wealthy you will see denied</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Comforts and joys that with the poor abide:                     </p>
<p>There are who labour through the year, and yet</p>
<p>No more have gain'd than&mdash;not to be in debt;</p>
<p>Who still maintain the same laborious course,</p>
<p>Yet pleasure hails them from some favourite source;</p>
<p>And health, amusements, children, wife or friend,</p>
<p>With life's dull views their consolations blend.</p>
<p class="i1">Nor these alone possess the lenient power</p>
<p>Of soothing life in the desponding hour;</p>
<p>Some favourite studies, some delightful care,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>The mind with trouble and distresses share;                     </p>
<p>And by a coin, a flower, a verse, a boat,</p>
<p>The stagnant spirits have been set afloat;</p>
<p>They pleased at first, and then the habit grew,</p>
<p>Till the fond heart no higher pleasure knew;</p>
<p>Till, from all cares and other comforts freed,</p>
<p>Th' important nothing took in life the lead.</p>
<p class="i1">With all his phlegm, it broke a Dutchman's heart,</p>
<p>At a vast price with one loved root to part;</p>
<p>And toys like these fill many a British mind,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Although their hearts are found of firmer kind.                 </p>
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359" class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</a>
<p class="i1">Oft have I smiled the happy pride to see</p>
<p>Of humble tradesmen, in their evening glee;</p>

<p>Whether the call-bird yield the hour's delight,</p>

<p>Who broke that morning from their half-year's sleep,</p>
<p>To fly o'er flow'rs where they were wont to creep.</p>
<p class="i1">Above the sovereign oak a sovereign skims,</p>
<p>The purple Emp'ror, strong in wing and limbs:</p>

<p>There fair Camilla takes her flight serene,                     </p>
<p>Adonis blue, and Paphia, silver-queen;</p>
<p>With every filmy fly from mead or bower,</p>
<p>And hungry Sphinx, who threads the honey'd flower;</p>
<p>She o'er the Larkspur's bed, where sweets abound,</p>
<p>Views ev'ry bell, and hums th' approving sound;</p>
<p>Poised on her busy plumes, with feeling nice</p>
<p>She draws from every flower, nor tries a floret twice.</p>
<p class="i1">He fears no bailiff's wrath, no baron's blame,</p>
<p>His is untax'd and undisputed game;</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Nor less the place of curious plant he knows<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>;                </p>
<p>He both his Flora and his Fauna shows;</p>
<p>For him is blooming in its rich array</p>
<p>The glorious flower which bore the palm away;</p>
<p>In vain a rival tried his utmost art,</p>
<p>His was the prize, and joy o'erflow'd his heart.</p>
<p class="i1">"This, this is beauty! cast, I pray, your eyes</p>

<p>Was ever stem so tall, so stout, so strong,</p>
<p>Exact in breadth, in just proportion, long!</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>

<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p class="i1">Walter and William took (their father dead)       </p>
<p>Jointly the trade to which they both were bred;</p>
<p>When fix'd, they married, and they quickly found</p>
<p>With due success their honest labours crown'd:</p>
<p>Few were their losses, but, although a few,</p>
<p>Walter was vex'd, and somewhat peevish grew:</p>
<p>"You put your trust in every pleading fool,"</p>
<p>Said he to William, and grew strange and cool.</p>
<p>"Brother, forbear," he answer'd; "take your due,</p>
<p>Nor let my lack of caution injure you."</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Half friends they parted,&mdash;better so to close,                 </p>
<p>Than longer wait to part entirely foes.</p>
<p class="i1">Walter had knowledge, prudence, jealous care;</p>
<p>He let no idle views his bosom share;</p>
<p>He never thought nor felt for other <span class="locked">men&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Let one mind one, and all are minded then."</p>
<p>Friends he respected, and believed them just;</p>
<p>But they were men, and he would no man trust;</p>
<p>He tried and watch'd his people day and <span class="locked">night,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The good it harm'd not; for the bad 'twas right:</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>He could their humours bear, nay disrespect,                   </p>
<p>But he could yield no pardon to neglect;</p>
<p>That all about him were of him afraid,</p>
<p>"Was right," he said&mdash;"so should we be obey'd."</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">These merchant-maxims, much good-fortune too,    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And ever keeping one grand point in view,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>To vast amount his once small portion drew.                    </p>
<p class="i1">William was kind and easy; he complied</p>
<p>With all requests, or grieved when he denied;</p>
<p>To please his wife he made a costly trip,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>To please his child he let a bargain slip;                     </p>
<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361" class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</a>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Prone to compassion, mild with the distress'd,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>He bore with all who poverty profess'd,                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And some would he assist, nor one would he arrest.             </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>He had some loss at sea, bad debts at land,                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>His clerk absconded with some bills in hand,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>And plans so often fail'd that he no longer plann'd.          </p>
<p>To a small house (his brother's) he withdrew,</p>
<p>At easy rent&mdash;the man was not a Jew;</p>
<p>And there his losses and his cares he bore,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor.             </p>
<p class="i1">No, he in fact was rich; nor could he move,</p>
<p>But he was follow'd by the looks of love;</p>
<p>All he had suffer'd, every former grief,</p>
<p>Made those around more studious in relief;</p>
<p>He saw a cheerful smile in every face,</p>
<p>And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace.</p>
<p class="i1">Pleasant it was to see them in their walk</p>
<p>Round their small garden, and to hear them talk;</p>
<p>Free are their children, but their love refrains</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>From all offence&mdash;none murmurs, none complains;                </p>
<p>Whether a book amused them, speech or play,</p>
<p>Their looks were lively, and their hearts were gay;</p>
<p>There no forced efforts for delight were made,</p>
<p>Joy came with prudence, and without parade;</p>
<p>Their common comforts they had all in view,</p>
<p>Light were their troubles, and their wishes few;</p>
<p>Thrift made them easy for the coming day;</p>
<p>Religion took the dread of death away;</p>
<p>A cheerful spirit still insured content,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went.              </p>
<p class="i1">Walter, meantime, with all his wealth's increase,</p>
<p>Gain'd many points, but could not purchase peace;</p>
<p>When he withdrew from business for an hour,</p>
<p>Some fled his presence, all confess'd his power;</p>
<p>He sought affection, but received instead</p>
<p>Fear undisguised, and love-repelling dread;</p>
<p>He look'd around him&mdash;"Harriet, dost thou love?<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"I do my duty," said the timid <span class="locked">dove;&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Love, and they'll do whatever I desire.                        </p>
<p>Thus too my people shun me; I would spend</p>

<p>I would be happy&mdash;I have means to pay</p>
<p>For love and friendship, and you run away;</p>
<p>Ungrateful creatures! why, you seem to dread</p>

<p>Come hither, Nancy! you must hold me dear;</p>
<p>Hither, I say; why! what have you to fear?</p>
<p>You see I'm gentle&mdash;Come, you trifler, come;</p>

<p>In every better hope of life I fail;</p>
<p>You're all tormentors, and my house a jail;</p>
<p>Out of my sight! I'll sit and make my <span class="locked">will&mdash;</span></p>
<p>What, glad to go? stay, devils, and be still;</p>
<p>'Tis to your uncle's cot you wish to run,</p>

<p>This, it must be acknowledged, is contrary to the opinion of Thomson,
and I believe of some other poets, who, in describing the varying hues of
our most beautiful flowers, have considered them as lost and blended with
each other; whereas their beauty, in the eye of a florist (and I conceive in
that of the uninitiated also), depends upon the distinctness of their colours:
the stronger the bounding line, and the less they break into the neighbouring
tint, so much the richer and more valuable is the flower esteemed.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">AMUSEMENTS.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">Of our amusements ask you?&mdash;We amuse         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Ourselves and friends with sea-side walks and views,           </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>Or take a morning ride, a novel, or the news;                  </p>
<p>Or, seeking nothing, glide about the street,</p>
<p>And, so engaged, with various parties meet;</p>
<p>Awhile we stop, discourse of wind and tide,</p>
<p>Bathing and books, the raffle, and the ride:</p>
<p>Thus, with the aid which shops and sailing give,</p>
<p>Life passes on; 'tis labour, but we live.</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p class="i1">When evening comes, our invalids awake,          </p>
<p>Nerves cease to tremble, heads forbear to ache;</p>
<p>Then cheerful meals the sunken spirits raise,</p>
<p>Cards or the dance, wine, visiting, or plays.</p>
<p class="i1">Soon as the season comes, and crowds arrive,</p>
<p>To their superior rooms the wealthy drive;</p>
<p>Others look round for lodging snug and small,</p>
<p>Such is their taste&mdash;they've hatred to a hall;</p>
<p>Hence one his fav'rite habitation gets,</p>
<p>The brick-floor'd parlour which the butcher lets;</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Where, through his single light, he may regard                  </p>
<p>The various business of a common yard,</p>
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366" class="pagenum">[Pg 366]</a>
<p>Bounded by backs of buildings form'd of clay,</p>
<p>By stable, sties, and coops, et-cætera.</p>
<p class="i1">The needy-vain, themselves awhile to shun,</p>
<p>For dissipation to these dog-holes run;</p>
<p>Where each (assuming petty pomp) appears,</p>
<p>And quite forgets the shopboard and the shears.</p>
<p class="i1">For them are cheap amusements: they may slip</p>
<p>Beyond the town and take a private dip;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>When they may urge that to be safe they mean:                   </p>
<p>They've heard there's danger in a light machine;</p>
<p>They too can gratis move the quays about,</p>
<p>And gather kind replies to every doubt;</p>
<p>There they a pacing, lounging tribe may view,</p>
<p>The stranger's guides, who've little else to do;</p>
<p>The Borough's placemen, where no more they gain</p>
<p>Than keeps them idle, civil, poor, and vain.</p>
<p>Then may the poorest with the wealthy look</p>
<p>On ocean, glorious page of Nature's book!</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>May see its varying views in every hour,                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>All softness now, then rising with all power,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p><p>As sleeping to invite, or threat'ning to devour:               </p>
<p>'Tis this which gives us all our choicest views;</p>
<p>Its waters heal us, and its shores amuse.</p>
<p class="i1">See those fair nymphs upon that rising strand,</p>
<p>Yon long salt lake has parted from the land;</p>
<p>Well pleased to press that path, so clean, so pure,</p>
<p>To seem in danger, yet to feel secure;</p>
<p>Trifling with terror, while they strive to shun</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>The curling billows; laughing as they run;                      </p>
<p>They know the neck that joins the shore and sea,</p>
<p>Or, ah! how changed that fearless laugh would be.</p>
<p class="i1">Observe how various parties take their way,</p>
<p>By sea-side walks, or make the sand-hills gay;</p>
<p>There group'd are laughing maids and sighing swains,</p>
<p>And some apart who feel unpitied pains:</p>
<p>Pains from diseases, pains which those who feel</p>
<p>To the physician, not the fair, reveal;</p>
<p>For nymphs (propitious to the lover's sigh)</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Leave these poor patients to complain and die.                  </p>
<p class="i1">Lo! where on that huge anchor sadly leans</p>
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367" class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</a>
<p>That sick tall figure, lost in other scenes;</p>
<p>He late from India's clime impatient sail'd,</p>
<p>There, as his fortune grew, his spirits fail'd;</p>
<p>For each delight, in search of wealth he went,</p>
<p>For ease alone, the wealth acquired is <span class="locked">spent&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And spent in vain; enrich'd, aggriev'd, he sees</p>
<p>The envied poor possess'd of joy and ease;</p>
<p>And now he flies from place to place, to gain</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Strength for enjoyment, and still flies in vain.                </p>
<p>Mark, with what sadness, of that pleasant crew,</p>
<p>Boist'rous in mirth, he takes a transient view,</p>
<p>And, fixing then his eye upon the sea,</p>
<p>Thinks what has been and what must shortly be:</p>
<p>Is it not strange that man should health destroy,</p>
<p>For joys that come when he is dead to joy?</p>
<p class="i1">Now is it pleasant in the summer-eve,</p>
<p>When a broad shore retiring waters leave,</p>
<p>Awhile to wait upon the firm fair sand,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>When all is calm at sea, all still at land;                     </p>
<p>And there the ocean's produce to explore,</p>
<p>As floating by, or rolling on the shore;</p>
<p>Those living jellies<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which the flesh inflame,</p>
<p>Fierce as a nettle, and from that its name;</p>
<p>Some in huge masses, some that you may bring</p>
<p>In the small compass of a lady's ring;</p>
<p>Figured by hand divine&mdash;there's not a gem</p>
<p>Wrought by man's art to be compared to them;</p>
<p>Soft, brilliant, tender, through the wave they glow,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>And make the moon-beam brighter where they flow.                </p>
<p>Involved in sea-wrack, here you find a race,</p>
<p>Which science, doubting, knows not where to place;</p>
<p>On shell or stone is dropp'd the embryo-seed,</p>
<p>And quickly vegetates a vital breed<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect</p>
<p>Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject,</p>
<p>See as they float along th' entangled weeds</p>
<p>Slowly approach, upborne on bladdery beads;</p>
<p>Wait till they land, and you shall then behold</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>The fiery sparks those tangled frons' infold,                  </p>
<p>Myriads of living points<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>; th' unaided eye</p>
<a name="Page_368" id="Page_368" class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</a>
<p>Can but the fire and not the form descry.</p>
<p>And now your view upon the ocean turn,</p>
<p>And there the splendour of the waves discern;</p>
<p>Cast but a stone, or strike them with an oar,</p>
<p>And you shall flames within the deep explore;</p>
<p>Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand,</p>
<p>And the cold flames shall flash along your hand;</p>
<p>When, lost in wonder, you shall walk and gaze</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>On weeds that sparkle, and on waves that blaze<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.             </p>
<p class="i1">The ocean too has winter-views serene,</p>
<p>When all you see through densest fog is seen;</p>
<p>When you can hear the fishers near at hand</p>
<p>Distinctly speak, yet see not where they stand;</p>
<p>Or sometimes them and not their boat discern,</p>
<p>Or half-conceal'd some figure at the stern;</p>
<p>The view's all bounded, and from side to side</p>
<p>Your utmost prospect but a few ells wide;</p>
<p>Boys who, on shore, to sea the pebble cast,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Will hear it strike against the viewless mast;                 </p>
<p>While the stern boatman growls his fierce disdain,</p>
<p>At whom he knows not, whom he threats in vain.</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis pleasant then to view the nets float past,</p>
<p>Net after net till you have seen the last;</p>
<p>And as you wait till all beyond you slip,</p>
<p>A boat comes gliding from an anchor'd ship,</p>
<p>Breaking the silence with the dipping oar</p>
<p>And their own tones, as labouring for the <span class="locked">shore&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Those measured tones which with the scene agree,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>And give a sadness to serenity.                                </p>
<p class="i1">All scenes like these the tender maid should shun,</p>
<p>Nor to a misty beach in autumn run;</p>
<p>Much should she guard against the evening cold,</p>
<p>And her slight shape with fleecy warmth infold;</p>
<p>This she admits, but not with so much ease</p>
<p>Gives up the night-walk when th' attendants please.</p>
<p>Her have I seen, pale, vapour'd through the day,</p>
<p>With crowded parties at the midnight play;</p>
<p>Faint in the morn, no powers could she exert;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>At night with Pam delighted and alert;                         </p>
<p>In a small shop she's raffled with a crowd,</p>
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369" class="pagenum">[Pg 369]</a>
<p>Breathed the thick air, and cough'd and laugh'd aloud;</p>
<p>She, who will tremble if her eye explore</p>
<p>"The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor;"</p>
<p>Whom the kind doctor charged, with shaking head,</p>
<p>At early hour to quit the beaux for bed:</p>
<p>She has, contemning fear, gone down the dance,</p>
<p>Till she perceived the rosy morn advance;</p>
<p>Then has she wonder'd, fainting o'er her tea,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Her drops and juleps should so useless be:                     </p>
<p>Ah! sure her joys must ravish every sense,</p>
<p>Who buys a portion at so vast expense.</p>
<p class="i1">Among those joys, 'tis one at eve to sail</p>
<p>On the broad river with a favourite gale;</p>
<p>When no rough waves upon the bosom ride,</p>
<p>But the keel cuts, nor rises on the tide;</p>
<p>Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands,</p>
<p>Where playful children trail their idle hands,</p>
<p>Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>On either side of the impeded boat:                            </p>
<p>What time the moon, arising, shows the mud</p>
<p>A shining border to the silver flood;</p>
<p>When, by her dubious light, the meanest views,</p>
<p>Chalk, stones, and stakes, obtain the richest hues;</p>
<p>And when the cattle, as they gazing stand,</p>
<p>Seem nobler objects than when view'd from land.</p>
<p>Then anchor'd vessels in the way appear,</p>
<p>And sea-boys greet them as they pass&mdash;"What cheer?"</p>
<p>The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>And utter loud their unharmonious cries;                       </p>
<p>Fluttering, they move their weedy beds among,</p>
<p>Or, instant diving, hide their plumeless young.</p>
<p class="i1">Along the wall, returning from the town,</p>
<p>The weary rustic homeward wanders down;</p>
<p>Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew,</p>
<p>And feels his envy rising at the view;</p>
<p>He the light speech and laugh indignant hears,</p>
<p>And feels more press'd by want, more vex'd by fears.</p>
<p class="i1">Ah! go in peace, good fellow, to thine home,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Nor fancy these escape the general doom;                       </p>
<p>Gay as they seem, be sure with them are hearts</p>
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370" class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</a>
<p>With sorrow tried; there's sadness in their parts.</p>
<p>If thou couldst see them when they think alone,</p>
<p>Mirth, music, friends, and these amusements gone;</p>
<p>Couldst thou discover every secret ill</p>
<p>That pains their spirit, or resists their will;</p>
<p>Couldst thou behold forsaken Love's distress,</p>
<p>Or Envy's pang at glory and success,</p>
<p>Or Beauty, conscious of the spoils of Time,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Or Guilt, alarm'd when Memory shows the crime&mdash;                </p>
<p>All that gives sorrow, terror, grief, and gloom:</p>
<p>Content would cheer thee, trudging to thine home<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">There are, 'tis true, who lay their cares aside,</p>
<p>And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide;</p>
<p>Perchance some fair-one to the sober night</p>
<p>Adds (by the sweetness of her song) delight;</p>
<p>And, as the music on the water floats,</p>
<p>Some bolder shore returns the soften'd notes;</p>
<p>Then, youth, beware, for all around conspire</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>To banish caution and to wake desire;                          </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>The day's amusement, feasting, beauty, wine,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>These accents sweet and this soft hour combine,           </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>When most unguarded, then to win that heart of thine:          </p>
<p>But see, they land! the fond enchantment flies,</p>
<p>And in its place life's common views arise.</p>
<p class="i1">Sometimes a party, row'd from town, will land</p>
<p>On a small islet form'd of shelly sand,</p>
<p>Left by the water when the tides are low,</p>
<p>But which the floods in their return o'erflow:</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>There will they anchor, pleased awhile to view                 </p>
<p>The watery waste, a prospect wild and new;</p>
<p>The now receding billows give them space</p>
<p>On either side the growing shores to pace;</p>
<p>And then, returning, they contract the scene,</p>
<p>Till small and smaller grows the walk between,</p>
<p>As sea to sea approaches, shore to shores,</p>
<p>Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores.</p>
<p class="i1">Then what alarm! what danger and dismay,</p>
<p>If all their trust, their boat should drift away;</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>And once it happen'd&mdash;gay the friends advanced;                </p>
<p>They walk'd, they ran, they play'd, they sang, they danced;</p>
<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371" class="pagenum">[Pg 371]</a>
<p>The urns were boiling, and the cups went round,</p>
<p>And not a grave or thoughtful face was found;</p>
<p>On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet,</p>
<p>Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat;</p>
<p>The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head,</p>
<p>And waves ran softly up their shining bed.</p>
<p class="i1">Some form'd a party from the rest to stray,</p>
<p>Pleased to collect the trifles in their way;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>These to behold, they call their friends around&mdash;              </p>
<p>No friends can hear, or hear another sound;</p>
<p>Alarm'd, they hasten, yet perceive not why,</p>
<p>But catch the fear that quickens as they fly.</p>
<p class="i1">For lo! a lady sage, who paced the sand</p>
<p>With her fair children, one in either hand,</p>
<p>Intent on home, had turn'd, and saw the boat</p>
<p>Slipp'd from her moorings, and now far afloat;</p>
<p>She gazed, she trembled, and though faint her call,</p>
<p>It seem'd, like thunder, to confound them all.</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Their sailor-guides, the boatman and his mate,                 </p>
<p>Had drank, and slept regardless of their state;</p>
<p>"Awake!" they cried aloud; "Alarm the shore!</p>
<p>"Shout all, or never shall we reach it more!"</p>
<p>Alas! no shout the distant land can reach,</p>
<p>Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Again they join in one loud, powerful cry,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Then cease, and eager listen for reply;                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>None came&mdash;the rising wind blew sadly by.                      </p>
<p>They shout once more, and then they turn aside,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>To see how quickly flow'd the coming tide;                     </p>
<p>Between each cry they find the waters steal</p>
<p>On their strange prison, and new horrors feel;</p>
<p>Foot after foot on the contracted ground</p>
<p>The billows fall, and dreadful is the sound;</p>
<p>Less and yet less the sinking isle became,</p>
<p>And there was wailing, weeping, wrath, and blame.</p>
<p class="i1">Had one been there, with spirit strong and high,</p>
<p>Who could observe, as he prepared to die:</p>
<p>He might have seen of hearts the varying kind,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>And traced the movement of each different mind;                </p>
<p>He might have seen, that not the gentle maid</p>
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372" class="pagenum">[Pg 372]</a>
<p>Was more than stern and haughty man afraid;</p>
<p>Such calmly grieving, will their fears suppress,</p>
<p>And silent prayers to Mercy's throne address;</p>
<p>While fiercer minds, impatient, angry, loud,</p>
<p>Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd.</p>
<p>The party's patron, sorely sighing, cried,</p>
<p>"Why would you urge me? I at first denied."</p>
<p>Fiercely they answer'd, "Why will you complain,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>"Who saw no danger, or was warn'd in vain?"                    </p>
<p>A few essay'd the troubled soul to calm;</p>
<p>But dread prevail'd, and anguish and alarm.</p>
<p class="i1">Now rose the water through the lessening sand,</p>
<p>And they seem'd sinking while they yet could stand;</p>
<p>The sun went down, they look'd from side to side,</p>
<p>Nor aught except the gathering sea descried;</p>
<p>Dark and more dark, more wet, more cold it grew,</p>
<p>And the most lively bade to hope adieu;</p>
<p>Children, by love then lifted from the seas,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>Felt not the waters at the parents' knees,                     </p>
<p>But wept aloud; the wind increased the sound,</p>
<p>And the cold billows as they broke around.</p>
<p class="i1">"Once more, yet once again, with all our strength,</p>
<p>Cry to the land&mdash;we may be heard at length."</p>
<p>Vain hope, if yet unseen! but hark! an oar,</p>
<p>That sound of bliss! comes dashing to their shore;</p>
<p>Still, still the water rises; "Haste!" they cry,</p>
<p>"Oh! hurry, seamen; in delay we die;"</p>
<p>(Seamen were these, who in their ship perceived</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>The drifted boat, and thus her crew relieved.)                 </p>
<p>And now the keel just cuts the cover'd sand,</p>
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373" class="pagenum">[Pg 373]</a>
<p>Now to the gunwale stretches every hand;</p>
<p>With trembling pleasure all confused embark,</p>
<p>And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark;</p>
<p>While the most giddy, as they reach the shore,</p>
<p>Think of their danger, and their <span class="smcap">God</span> adore.</p>

<div class="poemfn"><p> <i>Those living jellies which the flesh inflame.</i> </p></div>

<p>Some of the smaller species of the Medusa (sea-nettle) are exquisitely
beautiful: their form is nearly oval, varied with serrated longitudinal lines;
they are extremely tender, and by no means which I am acquainted with
can be preserved, for they soon dissolve in either spirit of wine or water,
and lose every vestige of their shape, and indeed of their substance: the
larger species are found in mis-shapen masses of many pounds weight;
these, when handled, have the effect of the nettle, and the stinging is often
accompanied or succeeded by the more unpleasant feeling, perhaps in a
slight degree resembling that caused by the torpedo.</p>

<div class="poemfn"><p> <i>And quickly vegetates a vital breed.</i> </p></div>

<p>Various tribes and species of marine vermes are here meant: that which
so nearly resembles a vegetable in its form, and perhaps, in some degree,
manner of growth, is the coralline called by naturalists Sertularia, of
which there are many species in almost every part of the coast. The
animal protrudes its many claws (apparently in search of prey) from
certain pellucid vesicles which proceed from a horny, tenacious, branchy
stem.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER X.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>You say you envy in your calm retreat</p>
<p>Our social meetings;&mdash;'tis with joy we meet.</p>
<p>In these our parties you are pleased to find</p>
<p>Good sense and wit, with intercourse of mind;</p>
<p>Composed of men, who read, reflect, and write;</p>
<p>Who, when they meet, must yield and share delight.</p>
<p>To you our Book-club has peculiar charm,</p>
<p>For which you sicken in your quiet farm;</p>
<p>Here you suppose us at our leisure placed,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Enjoying freedom, and displaying taste;                         </p>
<p>With wisdom cheerful, temperately gay,</p>
<p>Pleased to enjoy, and willing to display.</p>
<p class="i1">If thus your envy gives your ease its gloom,</p>
<p>Give wings to fancy, and among us come.</p>
<p>We're now assembled; you may soon <span class="locked">attend&mdash;</span></p>
<p>I'll introduce you&mdash;"Gentlemen, my <span class="locked">friend."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Now are you happy? you have pass'd a night</p>
<p>In gay discourse, and rational <span class="locked">delight."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Alas! not so; for how can mortals think,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Or thoughts exchange, if thus they eat and drink?               </p>
<p>No! I confess, when we had fairly dined,</p>
<a name="Page_376" id="Page_376" class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</a>
<p>That was no time for intercourse of mind;</p>
<p>There was each dish prepared with skill t' invite,</p>
<p>And to detain the struggling appetite;</p>
<p>On such occasions minds with one consent</p>
<p>Are to the comforts of the body lent;</p>
<p>There was no pause&mdash;the wine went quickly round,</p>
<p>Till struggling Fancy was by Bacchus bound;</p>
<p>Wine is to wit as water thrown on fire:</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>By duly sprinkling, both are raised the higher;                 </p>
<p>Thus largely dealt, the vivid blaze they choke,</p>
<p>And all the genial flame goes off in <span class="locked">smoke."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"But when no more your boards these loads contain,</p>
<p>When wine no more o'erwhelms the labouring brain,</p>
<p>But serves, a gentle stimulus: we know</p>
<p>How wit must sparkle, and how fancy <span class="locked">flow."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">It might be so, but no such club-days come;</p>
<p>We always find these dampers in the room.</p>
<p>If to converse were all that brought us here,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>A few odd members would in turn appear;                         </p>
<p>Who, dwelling nigh, would saunter in and out,</p>
<p>O'erlook the list, and toss the books about;</p>
<p>Or, yawning, read them, walking up and down,</p>
<p>Just as the loungers in the shops in town;</p>
<p>Till, fancying nothing would their minds amuse,</p>
<p>They'd push them by, and go in search of news.</p>
<p class="i1">But our attractions are a stronger sort,</p>
<p>The earliest dainties and the oldest port;</p>
<p>All enter then with glee in every look,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>And not a member thinks about a book.                           </p>
<p class="i1">Still let me own, there are some vacant hours,</p>
<p>When minds might work, and men exert their powers:</p>
<p>Ere wine to folly spurs the giddy guest,</p>
<p>But gives to wit its vigour and its zest;</p>
<p>Then might we reason, might in turn display</p>
<p>Our several talents, and be wisely gay;</p>
<p>We might&mdash;but who a tame discourse regards,</p>
<p>When whist is named, and we behold the cards?</p>
<p class="i1">We from that time are neither grave nor gay;</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Our thought, our care, our business is to play:                 </p>
<p>Fix'd on these spots and figures, each attends</p>
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377" class="pagenum">[Pg 377]</a>
<p>Much to his partners, nothing to his friends.</p>
<p class="i1">Our public cares, the long, the warm debate,</p>
<p>That kept our patriots from their beds so late;</p>
<p>War, peace, invasion, all we hope or dread,</p>
<p>Vanish like dreams when men forsake their bed;</p>
<p>And groaning nations and contending kings</p>
<p>Are all forgotten for these painted things:</p>
<p>Paper and paste, vile figures and poor spots,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Level all minds, philosophers and sots;                         </p>
<p>And give an equal spirit, pause, and force,</p>
<p>Join'd with peculiar diction, to discourse:</p>
<p>"Who deals?&mdash;you led&mdash;we're three by cards&mdash;had you</p>
<p>Honour in hand?"&mdash;"Upon my honour, two."</p>
<p>Hour after hour, men thus contending sit,</p>
<p>Grave without sense, and pointed without wit.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus it appears these envied clubs possess</p>
<p>No certain means of social happiness;</p>
<p>Yet there's a good that flows from scenes like <span class="locked">these&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Man meets with man at leisure and at ease;                      </p>
<p>We to our neighbours and our equals come,</p>
<p>And rub off pride that man contracts at home;</p>
<p>For there, admitted master, he is prone</p>
<p>To claim attention and to talk alone:</p>
<p>But here he meets with neither son nor spouse;</p>
<p>No humble cousin to his bidding bows;</p>
<p>To his raised voice his neighbours' voices rise;</p>
<p>To his high look as lofty look replies;</p>
<p>When much he speaks, he finds that ears are closed,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>And certain signs inform him when he's prosed;                  </p>
<p>Here all the value of a listener know,</p>
<p>And claim, in turn, the favour they bestow.</p>
<p class="i1">No pleasure gives the speech, when all would speak,</p>
<p>And all in vain a civil hearer seek.</p>
<p>To chance alone we owe the free discourse,</p>
<p>In vain you purpose what you cannot force;</p>
<p>'Tis when the favourite themes unbidden spring,</p>
<p>That fancy soars with such unwearied wing;</p>
<p>Then may you call in aid the moderate glass,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>But let it slowly and unprompted pass;                         </p>
<p>So shall there all things for the end unite,</p>
<p>And give that hour of rational delight.</p>
<p class="i1">Men to their clubs repair, themselves to please,</p>
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378" class="pagenum">[Pg 378]</a>
<p>To care for nothing, and to take their ease;</p>
<p>In fact, for play, for wine, for news they come;</p>
<p>Discourse is shared with friends, or found at home.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">But cards with books are incidental things;</p>
<p>We've nights devoted to these queens and kings.</p>
<p>Then, if we choose the social game, we may;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Now, 'tis a duty, and we're bound to play;                     </p>
<p>Nor ever meeting of the social kind</p>
<p>Was more engaging, yet had less of mind.</p>
<p class="i1">Our eager parties, when the lunar light</p>
<p>Throws its full radiance on the festive night,</p>
<p>Of either sex, with punctual hurry come,</p>
<p>And fill, with one accord, an ample room.</p>
<p>Pleased, the fresh packs on cloth of green they see,</p>
<p>And, seizing, handle with preluding glee;</p>
<p>They draw, they sit, they shuffle, cut and deal;</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Like friends assembled, but like foes to feel:                 </p>
<p>But yet not all&mdash;a happier few have joys</p>
<p>Of mere amusement, and their cards are toys;</p>
<p>No skill nor art, nor fretful hopes have they,</p>
<p>But while their friends are gaming, laugh and play.</p>
<p class="i1">Others there are, the veterans of the game,</p>
<p>Who owe their pleasure to their envied fame;</p>
<p>Through many a year, with hard-contested strife,</p>
<p>Have they attain'd this glory of their life.</p>
<p>Such is that ancient burgess, whom in vain</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Would gout and fever on his couch detain;                      </p>
<p>And that large lady, who resolves to come,</p>
<p>Though a first fit has warn'd her of her doom!</p>
<p>These are as oracles: in every cause</p>
<p>They settle doubts, and their decrees are laws;</p>
<p>But all are troubled, when, with dubious look,</p>
<p>Diana questions what Apollo spoke.</p>
<p class="i1">Here avarice first, the keen desire of gain,</p>
<p>Rules in each heart, and works in every brain;</p>
<p>Alike the veteran-dames and virgins feel,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Nor care what gray-beards or what striplings deal;             </p>
<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379" class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</a>
<p>Sex, age, and station, vanish from their view,</p>
<p>And gold, their sov'reign good, the mingled crowd pursue.</p>
<p class="i1">Hence they are jealous, and as rivals, keep</p>
<p>A watchful eye on the beloved heap;</p>
<p>Meantime discretion bids the tongue be still,</p>
<p>And mild good-humour strives with strong ill-will;</p>
<p>Till prudence fails; when, all impatient grown,</p>
<p>They make their grief, by their suspicions, known.</p>
<p class="i1">"Sir, I protest, were Job himself at play,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>He'd rave to see you throw your cards away;                    </p>
<p>Not that I care a button&mdash;not a pin</p>
<p>For what I lose; but we had cards to win:</p>
<p>A saint in heaven would grieve to see such hand</p>
<p>Cut up by one who will not <span class="locked">understand."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Complain of me! and so you might indeed,</p>
<p>If I had ventured on that foolish lead,</p>
<p>That fatal heart&mdash;but I forgot your <span class="locked">play&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Some folk have ever thrown their hearts <span class="locked">away."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Yes, and their diamonds; I have heard of one</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Who made a beggar of an only son."&mdash;                           </p>
<p class="i1">"Better a beggar, than to see him tied</p>
<p>To art and spite, to insolence and <span class="locked">pride."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Sir, were I you, I'd strive to be polite,</p>
<p>Against my nature, for a single <span class="locked">night."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"So did you strive, and, madam! with success;</p>
<p>I knew no being we could censure less!<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">Is this too much? alas! my peaceful muse</p>
<p>Cannot with half their virulence abuse.</p>
<p>And hark! at other tables discord reigns,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>With feign'd contempt for losses and for gains;                </p>
<p>Passions awhile are bridled; then they rage,</p>
<p>In waspish youth, and in resentful age;</p>
<p>With scraps of insult&mdash;"Sir, when next you play,</p>
<p>Reflect whose money 'tis you throw away.</p>
<p>No one on earth can less such things regard,</p>
<p>But when one's partner doesn't know a card&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p class="i1">"I scorn suspicion, ma'am, but while you stand</p>
<p>Behind that lady, pray keep down your <span class="locked">hand."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Good heav'n, revoke! remember, if the set</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Be lost, in honour you should pay the debt."&mdash;                 </p>
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380" class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</a>
<p class="i1">"There, there's your money; but, while I have life,</p>
<p>I'll never more sit down with man and wife;</p>
<p>They snap and snarl indeed, but in the heat</p>
<p>Of all their spleen, their understandings meet;</p>
<p>They are Freemasons, and have many a sign,</p>
<p>That we, poor devils! never can divine:</p>
<p>May it be told, do ye divide th' amount,</p>
<p>Or goes it all to family account?"</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Next is the club, where to their friends in town</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Our country neighbours once a month come down;                 </p>
<p>We term it Free-and-easy, and yet we</p>
<p>Find it no easy matter to be free:</p>
<p>Ev'n in our small assembly, friends among,</p>
<p>Are minds perverse, there's something will be wrong;</p>
<p>Men are not equal; some will claim a right</p>
<p>To be the kings and heroes of the night;</p>
<p>Will their own favourite themes and notions start,</p>
<p>And you must hear, offend them, or depart.</p>
<p class="i1">There comes Sir Thomas from his village-seat,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Happy, he tells us, all his friends to meet;                   </p>
<p>He brings the ruin'd brother of his wife,</p>
<p>Whom he supports, and makes him sick of life:</p>
<p>A ready witness whom he can produce</p>
<p>Of all his deeds&mdash;a butt for his abuse.</p>
<p>Soon as he enters, has the guests espied,</p>
<p>Drawn to the fire, and to the glass <span class="locked">applied&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Well, what's the subject?&mdash;what are you about?</p>
<p>The news, I take it&mdash;come, I'll help you <span class="locked">out;"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And then, without one answer, he bestows</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Freely upon us all he hears and knows;                         </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Gives us opinions, tells us how he votes,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Recites the speeches, adds to them his notes,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And gives old ill-told tales for new-born anecdotes;           </p>
<p>Yet cares he nothing what we judge or think,</p>
<p>Our only duty's to attend and drink.</p>
<p>At length, admonish'd by his gout, he ends</p>
<p>The various speech, and leaves at peace his friends;</p>
<p>But now, alas! we've lost the pleasant hour,</p>
<a name="Page_381" id="Page_381" class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</a>
<p>And wisdom flies from wine's superior power.</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p class="i1">Wine, like the rising sun, possession gains,       </p>
<p>And drives the mist of dulness from the brains;</p>
<p>The gloomy vapour from the spirit flies,</p>
<p>And views of gaiety and gladness rise.</p>
<p>Still it proceeds, till from the glowing heat,</p>
<p>The prudent calmly to their shades <span class="locked">retreat;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Then is the mind o'ercast&mdash;in wordy rage</p>
<p>And loud contention angry men engage;</p>
<p>Then spleen and pique, like fire-works thrown in spite,</p>
<p>To mischief turn the pleasures of the night;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Anger abuses, Malice loudly rails,                             </p>
<p>Revenge awakes, and Anarchy prevails:</p>
<p>Till wine, that raised the tempest, makes it cease,</p>
<p>And maudlin Love insists on instant peace;</p>
<p>He noisy mirth and roaring song commands,</p>
<p>Gives idle toasts, and joins unfriendly hands;</p>
<p>Till fuddled Friendship vows esteem and weeps,</p>
<p>And jovial Folly drinks and sings and sleeps.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">A club there is of Smokers.&mdash;Dare you come</p>
<p>To that close, clouded, hot, narcotic room?</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>When, midnight past, the very candles seem                     </p>
<p>Dying for air, and give a ghastly gleam;</p>
<p>When curling fumes in lazy wreaths arise,</p>
<p>And prosing topers rub their winking eyes;</p>
<p>When the long tale, renew'd when last they met,</p>
<p>Is spliced anew, and is unfinish'd yet;</p>
<p>When but a few are left the house to tire,</p>
<p>And they half-sleeping by the sleepy fire;</p>
<p>Ev'n the poor ventilating vane, that flew</p>
<p>Of late so fast, is now grown drowsy too;</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>When sweet, cold, clammy punch its aid bestows,                </p>
<p>Then thus the midnight conversation <span class="locked">flows:&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Then, as I said, and&mdash;mind me&mdash;as I say,</p>
<p>At our last meeting&mdash;you remember"&mdash;"Ay;"</p>

<p>I spoke my thought&mdash;you take me&mdash;what I think:</p>
<p>And sir, said I, if I a freeman be,</p>
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382" class="pagenum">[Pg 382]</a>
<p>It is my bounden duty to be <span class="locked">free."&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Ay, there you posed him; I respect the chair,</p>
<p>But man is man, although the man's a mayor.</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>If Muggins live&mdash;no, no!&mdash;if Muggins die,                      </p>
<p>He'll quit his office&mdash;neighbour, shall I try?<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"I'll speak my mind, for here are none but friends:</p>
<p>They're all contending for their private ends;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>No public spirit, once a vote would bring;                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>I say a vote was then a pretty thing;                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>It made a man to serve his country and his king.               </p>
<p>But for that place, that Muggins must resign,</p>

<p class="i1">Masons are ours. Freemasons&mdash;but, alas!</p>
<p>To their own bards I leave the mystic class;</p>
<p>In vain shall one, and not a gifted man,</p>
<p>Attempt to sing of this enlighten'd clan:</p>
<p>I know no word, boast no directing sign,</p>
<p>And not one token of the race is mine;</p>
<p>Whether with Hiram, that wise widow's son,</p>

<p>Boaz and Jachin through the East renown'd:                     </p>
<p>Whether the sacred books their rise express,</p>
<p>Or books profane, 'tis vain for me to guess.</p>
<p>It may be, lost in date remote and high,</p>
<p>They know not what their own antiquity;</p>
<p>It may be too, derived from cause so low,</p>
<p>They have no wish their origin to show.</p>
<p>If, as crusaders, they combined to wrest</p>
<p>From heathen lords the land they long possess'd,</p>
<p>Or were at first some harmless club, who made</p>

<p>Their idle meetings solemn by parade,                          </p>
<p>Is but conjecture&mdash;for the task unfit,</p>
<p>Awe-struck and mute, the puzzling theme I quit.</p>
<p>Yet, if such blessings from their order flow,</p>
<p>We should be glad their moral code to know;</p>
<p>Trowels of silver are but simple things,</p>
<p>And aprons worthless as their apron-strings;</p>
<p>But, if indeed you have the skill to teach</p>
<p>A social spirit, now beyond our reach;</p>
<p>If man's warm passions you can guide and bind,</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>And plant the virtues in the wayward mind;                     </p>
<p>If you can wake to christian-love the <span class="locked">heart&mdash;</span></p>
<p>In mercy, something of your powers impart.</p>
<p class="i1">But, as it seems, we Masons must become</p>
<p>To know the secret, and must then be dumb;</p>
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384" class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</a>
<p>And, as we venture for uncertain gains,</p>
<p>Perhaps the profit is not worth the pains.</p>
<p class="i1">When Bruce, the dauntless traveller, thought he stood</p>
<p>On Nile's first rise, the fountain of the flood,</p>

<p>The critics told him, it was no such thing;                    </p>
<p>That springs unnumber'd round the country ran,</p>
<p>But none could show him where they first began:</p>
<p>So might we feel, should we our time bestow</p>
<p>To gain these secrets and these signs to know;</p>
<p>Might question still if all the truth we found,</p>
<p>And firmly stood upon the certain ground;</p>

<p>All the comforts of life in a tavern are known,</p>
<p>'Tis his home who possesses not one of his own;</p>
<p>And to him who has rather too much of that one,</p>
<p>'Tis the house of a friend where he's welcome to run:</p>
<p>The instant you enter my door you're my lord,</p>
<p>With whose taste and whose pleasure I'm proud to accord;</p>
<p>And the louder you call and the longer you stay,</p>
<p>The more I am happy to serve and obey.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>To the house of a friend if you're pleased to retire,</p>
<p>You must all things admit, you must all things admire;</p>
<p>You must pay with observance the price of your treat,</p>
<p>You must eat what is praised, and must praise what you eat:</p>
<p>But here you may come, and no tax we require,</p>
<p>You may loudly condemn what you greatly admire;</p>
<p>You may growl at our wishes and pains to excel,</p>
<p>And may snarl at the rascals who please you so well.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>At your wish we attend, and confess that your speech</p>

<p>Should rebellions arise in your own little state,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">Much do I need, and therefore will I ask,</p>
<p>A Muse to aid me in my present task;</p>
<p>For then with special cause we beg for aid,</p>
<p>When of our subject we are most afraid:</p>
<p>Inns are this subject&mdash;'tis an ill-drawn lot;</p>
<p>So, thou who gravely triflest, fail me not.</p>
<p>Fail not, but haste, and to my memory bring</p>
<p>Scenes yet unsung, which few would choose to sing:</p>
<p>Thou mad'st a Shilling splendid; thou hast thrown</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>On humble themes the graces all thine own;                      </p>
<p>By thee the Mistress of a village-school</p>
<p>Became a queen, enthroned upon her stool;</p>
<p>And far beyond the rest thou gav'st to shine</p>
<p>Belinda's Lock&mdash;that deathless work was thine.</p>
<p class="i1">Come, lend thy cheerful light, and give to please</p>
<p>These seats of revelry, these scenes of ease;</p>
<p>Who sings of Inns much danger has to dread,</p>
<p>And needs assistance from the fountain-head.</p>
<p class="i1">High in the street, o'erlooking all the place,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>The rampant Lion shows his kingly face;                         </p>
<a name="Page_388" id="Page_388" class="pagenum">[Pg 388]</a>
<p>His ample jaws extend from side to side,</p>
<p>His eyes are glaring, and his nostrils wide;</p>
<p>In silver shag the sovereign form is dress'd;</p>
<p>A mane horrific sweeps his ample chest;</p>
<p>Elate with pride, he seems t' assert his reign,</p>
<p>And stands, the glory of his wide domain.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet nothing dreadful to his friends the sight,</p>
<p>But sign and pledge of welcome and delight:</p>
<p>To him the noblest guest the town detains</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Flies for repast, and in his court remains;                     </p>
<p>Him too the crowd with longing looks admire,</p>
<p>Sigh for his joys, and modestly retire;</p>
<p>Here not a comfort shall to them be lost</p>
<p>Who never ask or never feel the cost.</p>
<p class="i1">The ample yards on either side contain</p>
<p>Buildings where order and distinction <span class="locked">reign;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The splendid carriage of the wealthier guest,</p>
<p>The ready chaise and driver smartly dress'd;</p>
<p>Whiskeys and gigs and curricles are there,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And high-fed prancers, many a raw-boned pair.                   </p>
<p>On all without a lordly host sustains</p>
<p>The care of empire, and observant reigns;</p>
<p>The parting guest beholds him at his side,</p>
<p>With pomp obsequious, bending in his pride;</p>
<p>Round all the place his eyes all objects meet,</p>
<p>Attentive, silent, civil, and discreet.</p>
<p>O'er all within the lady-hostess rules,</p>
<p>Her bar she governs, and her kitchen schools;</p>
<p>To every guest th' appropriate speech is made,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>And every duty with distinction paid:                           </p>
<p>Respectful, easy, pleasant, or <span class="locked">polite&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Your honour's servant&mdash;Mister Smith, good night."</p>
<p class="i1">Next, but not near, yet honour'd through the town,</p>
<p>There swing, incongruous pair! the Bear and Crown;</p>
<p>That Crown suspended gems and ribands deck,</p>
<p>A golden chain hangs o'er that furry neck.</p>
<p>Unlike the nobler beast, the Bear is bound,</p>
<p>And with the Crown so near him, scowls uncrown'd;</p>
<p>Less his dominion, but alert are all</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Without, within, and ready for the call;                        </p>
<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389" class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</a>
<p>Smart lads and light run nimbly here and there,</p>
<p>Nor for neglected duties mourns the Bear.</p>
<p class="i1">To his retreats, on the election-day,</p>
<p>The losing party found their silent way;</p>
<p>There they partook of each consoling good,</p>
<p>Like him uncrown'd, like him in sullen <span class="locked">mood&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Threat'ning, but bound.&mdash;Here meet a social kind,</p>
<p>Our various clubs, for various cause combined;</p>
<p>Nor has he pride, but thankful takes as gain</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>The dew-drops shaken from the Lion's mane:                      </p>
<p>A thriving couple here their skill display,</p>
<p>And share the profits of no vulgar sway.</p>
<p class="i1">Third in our Borough's list appears the sign</p>
<p>Of a fair queen&mdash;the gracious Caroline;</p>
<p>But in decay&mdash;each feature in the face</p>
<p>Has stain of Time, and token of disgrace.</p>
<p>The storm of winter, and the summer-sun,</p>
<p>Have on that form their equal mischief done;</p>
<p>The features now are all disfigured seen,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>And not one charm adorns th' insulted queen:                    </p>
<p>To this poor face was never paint applied,</p>
<p>Th' unseemly work of cruel Time to hide;</p>
<p>Here we may rightly such neglect upbraid;</p>
<p>Paint on such faces is by prudence laid.</p>
<p>Large the domain, but all within combine</p>
<p>To correspond with the dishonour'd sign;</p>
<p>And all around dilapidates; you <span class="locked">call&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But none replies&mdash;they're inattentive all.</p>
<p>At length a ruin'd stable holds your steed,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>While you through large and dirty rooms proceed,                </p>
<p>Spacious and cold; a proof they once had been</p>
<p>In honour&mdash;now magnificently mean;</p>
<p>Till in some small half-furnish'd room you rest,</p>
<p>Whose dying fire denotes it had a guest.</p>
<p>In those you pass'd where former splendour reign'd,</p>
<p>You saw the carpets torn, the paper stain'd;</p>
<p>Squares of discordant glass in windows fix'd,</p>
<p>And paper oil'd in many a space betwixt;</p>
<p>A soil'd and broken sconce; a mirror crack'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>With table underpropp'd, and chairs new-back'd;                </p>
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390" class="pagenum">[Pg 390]</a>
<p>A marble side-slab with ten thousand stains,</p>
<p>And all an ancient tavern's poor remains.</p>
<p class="i1">With much entreaty, they your food prepare,</p>
<p>And acid wine afford, with meagre fare;</p>
<p>Heartless you sup; and when a dozen times</p>
<p>You've read the fractured window's senseless rhymes;</p>
<p>Have been assured that Ph&oelig;be Green was fair,</p>
<p>And Peter Jackson took his supper there:</p>
<p>You reach a chilling chamber, where you dread</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Damps, hot or cold, from a tremendous bed;                     </p>
<p>Late comes your sleep, and you are waken'd soon</p>
<p>By rustling tatters of the old festoon.</p>
<p class="i1">O'er this large building, thus by time defaced,</p>
<p>A servile couple has its owner placed,</p>
<p>Who, not unmindful that its style is large,</p>
<p>To lost magnificence adapt their charge.</p>
<p>Thus an old beauty, who has long declined,</p>
<p>Keeps former dues and dignity in mind;</p>
<p>And wills that all attention should be paid</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>For graces vanish'd and for charms decay'd.                    </p>
<p class="i1">Few years have pass'd, since brightly 'cross the way</p>
<p>Lights from each window shot the lengthen'd ray,</p>
<p>And busy looks in every face were seen,</p>
<p>Through the warm precincts of the reigning Queen.</p>
<p>There fires inviting blazed, and all around</p>
<p>Was heard the tinkling bells' seducing sound;</p>
<p>The nimble waiters to that sound from far</p>
<p>Sprang to the call, then hasten'd to the bar;</p>
<p>Where a glad priestess of the temple sway'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>The most obedient, and the most obey'd;                        </p>
<p>Rosy and round, adorn'd in crimson vest,</p>
<p>And flaming ribands at her ample breast,</p>
<p>She, skill'd like Circe, tried her guests to move</p>
<p>With looks of welcome and with words of love;</p>
<p>And such her potent charms, that men unwise</p>
<p>Were soon transform'd and fitted for the sties.</p>
<p class="i1">Her port in bottles stood, a well-stain'd row,</p>
<p>Drawn for the evening from the pipe below;</p>
<p>Three powerful spirits fill'd a parted case;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Some cordial-bottles stood in secret place;                    </p>
<a name="Page_391" id="Page_391" class="pagenum">[Pg 391]</a>
<p>Fair acid fruits in nets above were seen;</p>
<p>Her plate was splendid, and her glasses clean;</p>
<p>Basins and bowls were ready on the stand,</p>
<p>And measures clatter'd in her powerful hand.</p>
<p class="i1">Inferior houses now our notice claim,</p>
<p>But who shall deal them their appropriate fame?</p>
<p>Who shall the nice, yet known distinction, tell,</p>
<p>Between the peal complete and single bell?</p>
<p class="i1">Determine, ye, who on your shining nags</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Wear oil-skin beavers and bear seal-skin bags;                 </p>
<p>Or ye, grave topers, who with coy delight</p>
<p>Snugly enjoy the sweetness of the night;</p>
<p>Ye travellers all, superior inns denied</p>
<p>By moderate purse, the low by decent pride:</p>
<p>Come and determine,&mdash;will ye take your place</p>
<p>At the <i>full</i> orb, or <i>half</i> the lunar face?</p>
<p>With the Black-Boy or Angel will ye dine?</p>
<p>Will ye approve the Fountain or the Vine?</p>
<p>Horses the <i>white</i> or <i>black</i> will ye prefer?</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>The Silver-Swan, or swan opposed to her&mdash;                      </p>
<p>Rare bird! whose form the raven-plumage decks,</p>
<p>And graceful curve her three alluring necks?</p>
<p class="i1">All these a decent entertainment give,</p>
<p>And by their comforts comfortably live.</p>
<p class="i1">Shall I pass by the Boar?&mdash;there are who cry,</p>
<p>"Beware the Boar," and pass determined by:</p>
<p>Those dreadful tusks, those little peering eyes</p>
<p>And churning chaps, are tokens to the wise.</p>
<p>There dwells a kind old aunt, and there you see</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Some kind young nieces in her company&mdash;                        </p>
<p>Poor village nieces, whom the tender dame</p>
<p>Invites to town, and gives their beauty fame;</p>
<p>The grateful sisters feel th' important aid,</p>
<p>And the good aunt is flatter'd and repaid.</p>
<p class="i1">What though it may some cool observers strike,</p>
<p>That such fair sisters should be so unlike;</p>
<p>That still another and another comes,</p>
<p>And at the matron's table smiles and blooms;</p>
<p>That all appear as if they meant to stay</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Time undefined, nor name a parting day;                        </p>
<a name="Page_392" id="Page_392" class="pagenum">[Pg 392]</a>
<p>And yet, though all are valued, all are dear,</p>
<p>Causeless, they go, and seldom more appear:</p>
<p>Yet&mdash;let Suspicion hide her odious head,</p>
<p>And Scandal vengeance from a burgess <span class="locked">dread&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A pious friend, who with the ancient dame</p>
<p>At sober cribbage takes an evening game;</p>
<p>His cup beside him, through their play he quaffs,</p>
<p>And oft renews, and innocently laughs;</p>
<p>Or, growing serious, to the text resorts,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And from the Sunday-sermon makes reports;                      </p>
<p>While all, with grateful glee, his wish attend,</p>
<p>A grave protector and a powerful friend.</p>
<p>But Slander says, who indistinctly sees,</p>
<p>Once he was caught with Silvia on his <span class="locked">knees&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A cautious burgess with a careful wife</p>
<p>To be so caught!&mdash;'tis false, upon my life.</p>
<p class="i1">Next are a lower kind, yet not so low</p>
<p>But they, among them, their distinctions know;</p>
<p>And, when a thriving landlord aims so high</p>

<p>What favourite inn shall share his evening's pay;</p>
<p>Where he shall sit the social hour, and lose</p>
<p>His past day's labours and his next day's views.</p>
<p>Our seamen too have choice: one takes a trip</p>
<p>In the warm cabin of his favourite ship;</p>
<p>And on the morrow in the humbler boat</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>He rows, till fancy feels herself afloat;                      </p>
<p>Can he the sign&mdash;Three Jolly Sailors pass,</p>
<p>Who hears a fiddle and who sees a lass?</p>
<p>The Anchor too affords the seaman joys,</p>
<p>In small smoked room, all clamour, crowd, and noise;</p>
<p>Where a curved settle half surrounds the fire,</p>
<p>Where fifty voices purl and punch require.</p>
<p>They come for pleasure in their leisure hour,</p>
<p>And they enjoy it to their utmost power;</p>
<p>Standing they drink, they swearing smoke, while all</p>

<p>We're British tars, and British tars are kings."</p>
<p class="i1">But the Green-Man shall I pass by unsung,</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Which mine own James upon his sign-post hung?                  </p>
<p>His sign, his image,&mdash;for he once was seen</p>
<p>A squire's attendant, clad in keeper's green;</p>
<p>Ere yet, with wages more, and honour less,</p>
<p>He stood behind me in a graver dress.</p>
<p class="i1">James in an evil hour went forth to woo</p>
<p>Young Juliet Hart, and was her Romeo:</p>
<p>They'd seen the play, and thought it vastly sweet</p>
<p>For two young lovers by the moon to meet;</p>
<p>The nymph was gentle, of her favours free,</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Ev'n at a word&mdash;no Rosalind was she;                           </p>
<p>Nor, like that other Juliet, tried his truth</p>
<p>With&mdash;"Be thy purpose marriage, gentle youth?"</p>
<p>But him received, and heard his tender tale,</p>
<p>When sang the lark, and when the nightingale:</p>
<p>So in few months the generous lass was seen</p>
<p>I' the way that all the Capulets had been.</p>
<p class="i1">Then first repentance seized the amorous man,</p>
<p>And&mdash;shame on love&mdash;he reason'd and he ran;</p>
<p>The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>And the sad sounds, "for better and for worse."                </p>
<p class="i1">Yet could the lover not so far withdraw,</p>
<p>But he was haunted both by love and law:</p>
<p>Now law dismay'd him as he view'd its fangs,</p>
<p>Now pity seized him for his Juliet's pangs;</p>
<p>Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail,</p>
<p>Where all would blame him and where none might bail;</p>
<p>These drew him back, till Juliet's hut appear'd,</p>
<p>Where love had drawn him when he should have fear'd.</p>
<p class="i1">There sat the father in his wicker throne,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Uttering his curses in tremendous tone;                        </p>
<a name="Page_394" id="Page_394" class="pagenum">[Pg 394]</a>
<p>With foulest names his daughter he reviled,</p>
<p>And look'd a very Herod at the child:</p>
<p>Nor was she patient, but with equal scorn,</p>
<p>Bade him remember when his Joe was born:</p>
<p>Then rose the mother, eager to begin</p>
<p>Her plea for frailty, when the swain came in.</p>
<p class="i1">To him she turn'd, and other theme began,</p>
<p>Show'd him his boy, and bade him be a <span class="locked">man&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"An honest man, who, when he breaks the laws,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>Will make a woman honest if there's cause."                    </p>
<p>With lengthened speech she proved what came to pass</p>
<p>Was no reflection on a loving lass:</p>
<p>"If she your love as wife and mother claim,</p>
<p>What can it matter which was first the name?</p>
<p>But 'tis most base, 'tis perjury and theft,</p>
<p>When a lost girl is like a widow left;</p>
<p>The rogue who ruins"&mdash;here the father found</p>
<p>His spouse was treading on forbidden ground.</p>
<p class="i1">"That's not the point," quoth he,&mdash;"I don't suppose</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>My good friend Fletcher to be one of those;                    </p>
<p>What's done amiss he'll mend in proper <span class="locked">time&mdash;</span></p>
<p>I hate to hear of villany and crime.</p>
<p>'Twas my misfortune, in the days of youth,</p>
<p>To find two lasses pleading for my truth;</p>
<p>The case was hard, I would with all my soul</p>
<p>Have wedded both, but law is our control;</p>
<p>So one I took, and when we gain'd a home,</p>
<p>Her friend agreed&mdash;what could she more?&mdash;to come;</p>
<p>And when she found that I'd a widow'd bed,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>Me she desired&mdash;what could I less?&mdash;to wed.                    </p>
<p>An easier case is yours: you've not the smart</p>
<p>That two fond pleaders cause in one man's heart;</p>
<p>You've not to wait from year to year distress'd,</p>
<p>Before your conscience can be laid at rest;</p>
<p>There smiles your bride, there sprawls your new-born son,</p>
<p>&mdash;A ring, a licence, and the thing is done."</p>
<p class="i1">"My loving James,"&mdash;the lass began her plea,</p>
<p>"I'll make thy reason take a part with me.</p>
<p>Had I been froward, skittish, or unkind,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Or to thy person or thy passion blind;                         </p>
<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395" class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</a>
<p>Had I refused, when 'twas thy part to pray,</p>
<p>Or put thee off with promise and delay;</p>
<p>Thou might'st in justice and in conscience fly,</p>
<p>Denying her who taught thee to deny:</p>
<p>But, James, with me thou hadst an easier task,</p>
<p>Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask;</p>
<p>"I laid no traps for thee, no plots or plans,</p>
<p>Nor marriage named by licence or by banns;</p>
<p>Nor would I now the parson's aid employ,</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>But for this cause"&mdash;and up she held her boy.                  </p>
<p class="i1">Motives like these could heart of flesh resist?</p>
<p>James took the infant and in triumph kiss'd;</p>
<p>Then to his mother's arms the child restored,</p>
<p>Made his proud speech, and pledged his worthy word.</p>
<p class="i1">"Three times at church our banns shall publish'd be,</p>
<p>Thy health be drunk in bumpers three times three;</p>
<p>And thou shalt grace (bedeck'd in garments gay)</p>
<p>The christening-dinner on the wedding day."</p>
<p class="i1">James at my door then made his parting bow,</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>Took the Green-Man, and is a master now.                       </p>

<p>To take each part, and act in every age.                        </p>
<p>Cull'd from all houses, what a house are they!</p>
<p>Swept from all barns, our borough-critics say;</p>
<p>But with some portion of a critic's ire,</p>
<p>We all endure them; there are some admire:</p>

<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Whom justice pitying, chides from place to place,               </p>
<p>A wandering, careless, wretched, merry race;</p>
<p>Who cheerful looks assume, and play the parts</p>
<p>Of happy rovers with repining hearts;</p>
<p>Then cast off care, and in the mimic pain</p>
<p>Of tragic wo, feel spirits light and vain,</p>
<p>Distress and hope&mdash;the mind's, the body's wear,</p>
<p>The man's affliction, and the actor's tear:</p>
<p>Alternate times of fasting and excess</p>
<p>Are yours, ye smiling children of distress.</p>

<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p class="i1">Slaves though ye be, your wandering freedom seems,    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And with your varying views and restless schemes,         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Your griefs are transient, as your joys are dreams.            </p>
<p class="i1">Yet keen those griefs&mdash;ah! what avail thy charms,</p>
<p>Fair Juliet! what that infant in thine arms;</p>
<p>What those heroic lines thy patience learns,</p>
<p>What all the aid thy present Romeo earns,</p>
<p>Whilst thou art crowded in that lumbering wain,</p>
<p>With all thy plaintive sisters to complain?</p>
<p class="i1">Nor is there lack of labour.&mdash;To rehearse,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Day after day, poor scraps of prose and verse;                  </p>
<p>To bear each other's spirit, pride, and spite;</p>
<p>To hide in rant the heart-ache of the night;</p>
<p>To dress in gaudy patch-work, and to force</p>
<p>The mind to think on the appointed course:</p>
<p>This is laborious, and may be defined</p>
<p>The bootless labour of the thriftless mind.</p>
<p class="i1">There is a veteran dame&mdash;I see her stand</p>
<p>Intent and pensive with her book in hand;</p>
<p>Awhile her thoughts she forces on her part,</p>
<a name="Page_400" id="Page_400" class="pagenum">[Pg 400]</a>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Then dwells on objects nearer to the heart;                    </p>
<p>Across the room she paces, gets her tone,</p>
<p>And fits her features for the Danish throne;</p>
<p>To-night a queen&mdash;I mark her motion slow,</p>
<p>I hear her speech, and Hamlet's mother know.</p>
<p class="i1">Methinks 'tis pitiful to see her try</p>
<p>For strength of arms and energy of eye;</p>
<p>With vigour lost, and spirits worn away,</p>
<p>Her pomp and pride she labours to display;</p>
<p>And when awhile she's tried her part to act,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>To find her thoughts arrested by some fact;                    </p>
<p>When struggles more and more severe are seen</p>
<p>In the plain actress than the Danish <span class="locked">queen;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>At length she feels her part, she finds delight,</p>
<p>And fancies all the plaudits of the night:</p>
<p>Old as she is, she smiles at every speech,</p>
<p>And thinks no youthful part beyond her reach.</p>
<p>But, as the mist of vanity again</p>
<p>Is blown away by press of present pain,</p>
<p>Sad and in doubt she to her purse applies</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>For cause of comfort, where no comfort lies;                   </p>
<p>Then to her task she sighing turns <span class="locked">again,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Oh! Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!"</p>
<p class="i1">And who that poor, consumptive, wither'd thing,</p>
<p>Who strains her slender throat and strives to sing?</p>
<p>Panting for breath, and forced her voice to drop,</p>
<p>And far unlike the inmate of the shop,</p>
<p>Where she, in youth and health, alert and gay,</p>
<p>Laugh'd off at night the labours of the day;</p>
<p>With novels, verses, fancy's fertile powers,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>And sister-converse pass'd the evening-hours;                  </p>
<p>But Cynthia's soul was soft, her wishes strong,</p>
<p>Her judgment weak, and her conclusions wrong.</p>
<p>The morning-call and counter were her dread,</p>
<p>And her contempt the needle and the thread;</p>
<p>But, when she read a gentle damsel's part,</p>
<p>Her wo, her wish&mdash;she had them all by heart.</p>
<p class="i1">At length the hero of the boards drew nigh,</p>
<p>Who spake of love till sigh re-echo'd sigh;</p>
<p>He told in honey'd words his deathless flame,</p>
<a name="Page_401" id="Page_401" class="pagenum">[Pg 401]</a>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>And she his own by tender vows became;                         </p>
<p>Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond,</p>
<p>Alphonso's passion was his Cynthia's bond:</p>
<p>And thus the simple girl, to shame betray'd,</p>
<p>Sinks to the grave forsaken and dismay'd.</p>
<p class="i1">Sick without pity, sorrowing without hope,</p>
<p>See her, the grief and scandal of the troop;</p>
<p>A wretched martyr to a childish pride,</p>
<p>Her wo insulted, and her praise denied;</p>
<p>Her humble talents, though derided, used,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Her prospects lost, her confidence abused;                     </p>
<p>All that remains&mdash;for she not long can brave</p>
<p>Increase of evils&mdash;is an early grave,</p>
<p class="i1">Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop, take heed</p>
<p>What dreams ye cherish, and what books ye read.</p>
<p class="i1">A decent sum had Peter Nottage made,</p>
<p>By joining bricks&mdash;to him a thriving trade.</p>
<p>Of his employment master and his wife,</p>
<p>This humble tradesman led a lordly life;</p>
<p>The house of kings and heroes lack'd repairs,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>And Peter, though reluctant, served the players:               </p>
<p>Connected thus, he heard in way <span class="locked">polite,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Come, Master Nottage, see us play to-night."</p>
<p>At first 'twas folly, nonsense, idle stuff,</p>
<p>But seen for nothing it grew well enough;</p>
<p>And better now&mdash;now best, and every night</p>
<p>In this fool's paradise he drank delight;</p>
<p>And, as he felt the bliss, he wish'd to know</p>
<p>Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow;</p>
<p>For, if the seeing could such pleasure bring,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>What must the feeling?&mdash;feeling like a king?                   </p>
<p class="i1">In vain his wife, his uncle, and his friend,</p>
<p>Cried&mdash;"Peter! Peter! let such follies end;</p>
<p>'Tis well enough these vagabonds to see,</p>
<p>But would you partner with a showman be?"</p>
<p class="i1">"Showman!" said Peter, "did not Quin and Clive,</p>
<p>And Roscius-Garrick, by the science thrive?</p>
<p>Showman!&mdash;'tis scandal; I'm by genius led</p>
<p>To join a class who've Shakspeare at their head."</p>
<p class="i1">Poor Peter thus by easy steps became</p>
<a name="Page_402" id="Page_402" class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</a>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>A dreaming candidate for scenic fame;                          </p>
<p>And, after years consumed, infirm and poor,</p>
<p>He sits and takes the tickets at the door.</p>
<p class="i1">Of various men these marching troops are <span class="locked">made&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Pen-spurning clerks, and lads contemning trade;</p>
<p>Waiters and servants by confinement teased,</p>
<p>And youths of wealth by dissipation eased;</p>
<p>With feeling nymphs, who, such resource at hand,</p>
<p>Scorn to obey the rigour of command;</p>
<p>Some, who from higher views by vice are won,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And some of either sex by love undone;                         </p>
<p>The greater part lamenting as their fall</p>
<p>What some an honour and advancement call.</p>
<p class="i1">There are who names in shame or fear assume,</p>
<p>And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come:</p>
<p>It honours him, from tailor's board kick'd down,</p>
<p>As Mister Dormer to amuse the town;</p>
<p>Falling, he rises: but a kind there are</p>
<p>Who dwell on former prospects, and despair;</p>
<p>Justly, but vainly, they their fate deplore,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And mourn their fall who fell to rise no more.                 </p>
<p class="i1">Our merchant Thompson, with his sons around,</p>
<p>Most mind and talent in his Frederick found:</p>
<p>He was so lively, that his mother knew,</p>
<p>If he were taught, that honour must ensue;</p>
<p>The father's views were in a different line;</p>
<p>But if at college he were sure to shine,</p>
<p>Then should he go&mdash;to prosper, who could <span class="locked">doubt&mdash;</span></p>
<p>When school-boy stigmas would be all wash'd out;</p>
<p>For there were marks upon his youthful face,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>'Twixt vice and error&mdash;a neglected case:                       </p>
<p>These would submit to skill; a little time,</p>
<p>And none could trace the error or the crime;</p>
<p>Then let him go, and once at college, he</p>
<p>Might choose his station&mdash;what would Frederick be?</p>
<p class="i1">'Twas soon determined.&mdash;He could not descend</p>
<p>To pedant-laws and lectures without end;</p>
<p>And then the chapel&mdash;night and morn to pray,</p>
<p>Or mulct and threaten'd if he kept away;</p>
<p>No! not to be a bishop&mdash;so he swore,</p>
<a name="Page_403" id="Page_403" class="pagenum">[Pg 403]</a>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>And at his college he was seen no more.                        </p>
<p class="i1">His debts all paid, the father with a sigh,</p>
<p>Placed him in office&mdash;"Do, my Frederick, try;</p>
<p>"Confine thyself a few short months, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>He tried a fortnight, and threw down the pen.</p>
<p class="i1">Again demands were hush'd: "My son, you're free,</p>
<p>But you're unsettled; take your chance at sea:"</p>
<p>So in few days the midshipman equipp'd,</p>
<p>Received the mother's blessing and was shipp'd.</p>
<p class="i1">Hard was her fortune! soon compell'd to meet</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>The wretched stripling staggering through the street;          </p>
<p>For, rash, impetuous, insolent and vain,</p>
<p>The captain sent him to his friends again.</p>
<p>About the borough roved th' unhappy boy,</p>
<p>And ate the bread of every chance-employ;</p>
<p>Of friends he borrow'd, and the parents yet</p>
<p>In secret fondness authorised the debt;</p>
<p>The younger sister, still a child, was taught</p>
<p>To give with feign'd affright the pittance sought;</p>
<p>For now the father cried&mdash;"It is too late</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>For trial more&mdash;I leave him to his fate"&mdash;                     </p>
<p>Yet left him not; and with a kind of joy</p>
<p>The mother heard of her desponding boy:</p>
<p>At length he sicken'd, and he found, when sick,</p>
<p>All aid was ready, all attendance quick;</p>
<p>A fever seized him, and at once was lost</p>
<p>The thought of trespass, error, crime and cost;</p>
<p>Th' indulgent parents knelt beside the youth;</p>
<p>They heard his promise and believed his truth;</p>
<p>And, when the danger lessen'd on their view,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>They cast off doubt, and hope assurance grew;&mdash;                </p>
<p>Nursed by his sisters, cherish'd by his sire,</p>
<p>Begg'd to be glad, encouraged to aspire,</p>
<p>His life, they said, would now all care repay,</p>
<p>And he might date his prospects from that day;</p>
<p>A son, a brother to his home received,</p>
<p>They hoped for all things, and in all believed.</p>
<p class="i1">And now will pardon, comfort, kindness, draw</p>
<p>The youth from vice? will honour, duty, law?</p>
<p>Alas! not all: the more the trials lent,</p>
<a name="Page_404" id="Page_404" class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</a>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>The less he seem'd to ponder and repent;                       </p>
<p>Headstrong, determined in his own career,</p>
<p>He thought reproof unjust and truth severe;</p>
<p>The soul's disease was to its crisis come,</p>
<p>He first abused and then abjured his home;</p>
<p>And when he chose a vagabond to be,</p>
<p>He made his shame his glory&mdash;"I'll be free."</p>
<p class="i1">Friends, parents, relatives, hope, reason, love,</p>
<p>With anxious ardour for that empire strove;</p>
<p>In vain their strife, in vain the means applied,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>They had no comfort, but that all were tried;                  </p>
<p>One strong vain trial made, the mind to move,</p>
<p>Was the last effort of parental love.</p>
<p class="i1">Ev'n then he watch'd his father from his home,</p>
<p>And to his mother would for pity come,</p>
<p>Where, as he made her tender terrors rise,</p>
<p>He talk'd of death, and threaten'd for supplies.</p>
<p class="i1">Against a youth so vicious and undone</p>
<p>All hearts were closed, and every door but one:</p>
<p>The players received him; they with open heart</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>Gave him his portion and assign'd his part;                    </p>
<p>And ere three days were added to his life,</p>
<p>He found a home, a duty, and a wife.</p>
<p class="i1">His present friends, though they were nothing nice,</p>
<p>Nor ask'd how vicious he, or what his vice,</p>
<p>Still they expected he should now attend</p>
<p>To the joint duty as an useful friend;</p>
<p>The leader too declared, with frown severe,</p>
<p>That none should pawn a robe that kings might wear;</p>
<p>And much it moved him, when he Hamlet play'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>To see his Father's Ghost so drunken made.                     </p>
<p>Then too the temper, the unbending pride</p>
<p>Of this ally would no reproof <span class="locked">abide:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>So, leaving these, he march'd away and join'd</p>
<p>Another troop, and other goods purloin'd;</p>
<p>And other characters, both gay and sage,</p>
<p>Sober and sad, made stagger on the stage;</p>
<p>Then to rebuke, with arrogant disdain,</p>
<p>He gave abuse, and sought a home again.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus changing scenes, but with unchanging vice,</p>
<a name="Page_405" id="Page_405" class="pagenum">[Pg 405]</a>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Engaged by many, but with no one twice:                        </p>
<p>Of this, a last and poor resource, bereft,</p>
<p>He to himself, unhappy guide! was <span class="locked">left&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And who shall say where guided? to what seats</p>
<p>Of starving villany? of thieves and cheats?</p>
<p class="i1">In that sad time, of many a dismal scene</p>
<p>Had he a witness (not inactive) been;</p>
<p>Had leagued with petty pilferers, and had crept,</p>
<p>Where of each sex degraded numbers slept.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>With such associates he was long allied,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>Where his capacity for ill was tried,                          </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And, that once lost, the wretch was cast aside;                </p>
<p>For now, though willing with the worst to act,</p>
<p>He wanted powers for an important fact;</p>
<p>And, while he felt as lawless spirits feel,</p>
<p>His hand was palsied, and he couldn't steal.</p>
<p class="i1">By these rejected, is there lot so strange,</p>
<p>So low, that he could suffer by the change?</p>
<p>Yes! the new station as a fall we <span class="locked">judge&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He now became the harlot's humble drudge,</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>Their drudge in common: they combined to save                  </p>
<p>Awhile from starving their submissive slave;</p>
<p>For now his spirit left him, and his pride,</p>
<p>His scorn, his rancour, and resentment died;</p>
<p>Few were his feelings&mdash;but the keenest these,</p>
<p>The rage of hunger, and the sigh for ease;</p>
<p>He who abused indulgence, now became</p>
<p>By want subservient and by misery tame;</p>
<p>A slave, he begg'd forbearance; bent with pain,</p>
<p>He shunn'd the blow&mdash;"Ah! strike me not again."</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p class="i1">Thus was he found: the master of a hoy          </p>
<p>Saw the sad wretch, whom he had known a boy</p>
<p>At first in doubt; but Frederick laid aside</p>
<p>All shame, and humbly for his aid applied.</p>
<p>He, tamed and smitten with the storms gone by,</p>
<p>Look'd for compassion through one living eye,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>And stretch'd th' unpalsied hand; the seaman felt         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>His honest heart with gentle pity melt,                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And his small boon with cheerful frankness dealt;              </p>
<p>Then made inquiries of th' unhappy youth,</p>
<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406" class="pagenum">[Pg 406]</a>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>Who told, nor shame forbade him, all the truth.                </p>
<p class="i1">"Young Frederick Thompson to a chandler's shop</p>
<p>By harlots order'd and afraid to stop!&mdash;</p>
<p>What! our good merchant's favourite to be seen</p>
<p>In state so loathsome and in dress so mean?<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">So thought the seaman as he bade adieu,</p>
<p>And, when in port, related all he knew.</p>
<p class="i1">But time was lost, inquiry came too late,</p>
<p>Those whom he served knew nothing of his fate;</p>
<p>No! they had seized on what the sailor gave,</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>Nor bore resistance from their abject slave;                   </p>
<p>The spoil obtain'd, they cast him from the door,</p>
<p>Robb'd, beaten, hungry, pain'd, diseased and poor.</p>
<p class="i1">Then nature (pointing to the only spot</p>
<p>Which still had comfort for so dire a lot,)</p>
<p>Although so feeble, led him on the way,</p>
<p>And hope look'd forward to a happier day.</p>
<p>He thought, poor prodigal! a father yet</p>
<p>His woes would pity and his crimes forget;</p>
<p>Nor had he brother who with speech severe</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>Would check the pity or refrain the tear:                      </p>
<p>A lighter spirit in his bosom rose,</p>
<p>As near the road he sought an hour's repose.</p>
<p class="i1">And there he found it: he had left the town,</p>
<p>But buildings yet were scatter'd up and down;</p>
<p>To one of these, half-ruin'd and half-built,</p>
<p>Was traced this child of wretchedness and guilt;</p>
<p>There on the remnant of a beggar's vest,</p>
<p>Thrown by in scorn, the sufferer sought for rest;</p>
<p>There was this scene of vice and wo to close,</p>
<div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>And there the wretched body found repose.                      </p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Leave now our streets, and in yon plain behold</p>
<p>Those pleasant seats for the reduced and old;</p>
<p>A merchant's gift, whose wife and children died,</p>
<p>When he to saving all his powers applied;</p>
<p>He wore his coat till bare was every thread,</p>
<p>And with the meanest fare his body fed.</p>
<p>He had a female cousin, who with care</p>
<p>Walk'd in his steps and learn'd of him to spare;</p>
<p>With emulation and success they strove,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Improving still, still seeking to improve,                      </p>
<p>As if that useful knowledge they would <span class="locked">gain&mdash;</span></p>
<p>How little food would human life sustain:</p>
<p>No pauper came their table's crums to crave;</p>
<p>Scraping they lived, but not a scrap they gave:</p>
<p>When beggars saw the frugal merchant pass,</p>
<p>It moved their pity, and they said, "Alas!</p>
<p>Hard is thy fate, my brother," and they felt</p>
<p>A beggar's pride as they that pity dealt:</p>
<p>The dogs, who learn of man to scorn the poor,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Bark'd him away from ev'ry decent door;                         </p>
<p>While they who saw him bare, but thought him rich,</p>
<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409" class="pagenum">[Pg 409]</a>
<p>To show respect or scorn, they knew not which.</p>
<p class="i1">But while our merchant seem'd so base and mean,</p>
<p>He had his wanderings, sometimes, "not unseen;"</p>
<p>To give in secret was a favourite act,</p>
<p>Yet more than once they took him in the fact.</p>
<p>To scenes of various wo he nightly went,</p>
<p>And serious sums in healing misery spent;</p>
<p>Oft has he cheer'd the wretched, at a rate</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>For which he daily might have dined on plate;                   </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>He has been seen&mdash;his hair all silver-white,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Shaking and shining&mdash;as he stole by night,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>To feed unenvied on his still delight.                         </p>
<p>A two-fold taste he had: to give and spare,</p>
<p>Both were his duties, and had equal care;</p>
<p>It was his joy, to sit alone and fast,</p>
<p>Then send a widow and her boys repast.</p>
<p>Tears in his eyes would, spite of him, appear,</p>
<p>But he from other eyes has kept the tear:</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>All in a wint'ry night from far he came,                        </p>
<p>To soothe the sorrows of a suff'ring dame;</p>
<p>Whose husband robb'd him, and to whom he meant</p>
<p>A ling'ring, but reforming punishment.</p>
<p>Home then he walk'd, and found his anger rise,</p>
<p>When fire and rush-light met his troubled eyes;</p>
<p>But, these extinguish'd, and his prayer address'd</p>
<p>To Heaven in hope, he calmly sank to rest.</p>
<p class="i1">His seventieth year was pass'd, and then was seen</p>
<p>A building rising on the northern green;</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>There was no blinding all his neighbours' eyes,                 </p>
<p>Or surely no one would have seen it rise.</p>
<p>Twelve rooms contiguous stood, and six were near;</p>
<p>There men were placed, and sober matrons here;</p>
<p>There were behind small useful gardens made,</p>
<p>Benches before, and trees to give them shade;</p>
<p>In the first room were seen, above, below,</p>
<p>Some marks of taste, a few attempts at show;</p>
<p>The founder's picture and his arms were there</p>
<p>(Not till he left us), and an elbow'd chair;</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>There, 'mid these signs of his superior place,                  </p>
<p>Sat the mild ruler of this humble race.</p>
<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410" class="pagenum">[Pg 410]</a>
<p class="i1">Within the row are men who strove in vain,</p>
<p>Through years of trouble, wealth and ease to gain;</p>
<p>Less must they have than an appointed sum,</p>
<p>And freemen been, or hither must not come;</p>
<p>They should be decent and command respect</p>
<p>(Though needing fortune,) whom these doors protect,</p>
<p>And should for thirty dismal years have tried</p>
<p>For peace unfelt and competence denied.</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p class="i1">Strange, that o'er men thus train'd in sorrow's school,  </p>
<p>Power must be held, and they must live by rule!</p>
<p>Infirm, corrected by misfortunes, old,</p>
<p>Their habits settled and their passions cold;</p>
<p>Of health, wealth, power, and worldly cares, bereft,</p>
<p>Still must they not at liberty be left;</p>
<p>There must be one to rule them, to restrain</p>
<p>And guide the movements of his erring train.</p>
<p class="i1">If then control imperious, check severe,</p>
<p>Be needed where such reverend men appear;</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>To what would youth, without such checks, aspire,               </p>
<p>Free the wild wish, uncurb'd the strong desire?</p>
<p>And where (in college or in camp) they found</p>
<p>The heart ungovern'd and the hand unbound?</p>
<p class="i1">His house endow'd, the generous man resign'd</p>
<p>All power to rule, nay power of choice declined;</p>
<p>He and the female saint survived to view</p>
<p>Their work complete, and bade the world adieu!</p>
<p class="i1">Six are the guardians of this happy seat,</p>
<p>And one presides when they on business meet;</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>As each expires, the five a brother choose;                     </p>
<p>Nor would Sir Denys Brand the charge refuse;</p>
<p>True, 'twas beneath him, "but to do men good</p>
<p>Was motive never by his heart withstood."</p>
<p>He too is gone, and they again must strive</p>
<p>To find a man in whom his gifts survive.</p>
<p class="i1">Now, in the various records of the dead,</p>
<p>Thy worth, Sir Denys, shall be weigh'd and read;</p>
<p>There we the glory of thy house shall trace,</p>
<p>With each alliance of thy noble race.</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p class="i1">Yes! here we have him!&mdash;"Came in William's reign     </p>
<p>The Norman-Brand, the blood without a stain;</p>
<a name="Page_411" id="Page_411" class="pagenum">[Pg 411]</a>
<p>From the fierce Dane and ruder Saxon clear,</p>
<p>Pict, Irish, Scot, or Cambrian mountaineer;</p>
<p>But the pure Norman was the sacred spring,</p>
<p>And he, Sir Denys, was in heart a king:</p>
<p>Erect in person and so firm in soul,</p>
<p>Fortune he seem'd to govern and control;</p>
<p>"Generous as he who gives his all away,</p>
<p>Prudent as one who toils for weekly pay;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>In him all merits were decreed to meet&mdash;                       </p>
<p>Sincere though cautious, frank and yet discreet;</p>
<p>Just all his dealings, faithful every word;</p>
<p>His passions' master, and his temper's lord."</p>
<p class="i1">Yet more, kind dealers in decaying fame?</p>
<p>His magnanimity you next proclaim;</p>
<p>You give him learning, join'd with sound good sense,</p>
<p>And match his wealth with his benevolence;</p>
<p>What hides the multitude of sins, you <span class="locked">add&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yet seem to doubt if sins he ever had.</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i1">Poor honest Truth! thou writ'st of living men,      </p>
<p>And art a railer and detractor then;</p>
<p>They die, again to be described, and now</p>
<p>A foe to merit and mankind art thou!</p>
<p class="i1">Why banish truth? it injures not the dead;</p>
<p>It aids not them with flattery to be fed;</p>
<p>And, when mankind such perfect pictures view,</p>
<p>They copy less, the more they think them true.</p>
<p>Let us a mortal as he was behold,</p>
<p>And see the dross adhering to the gold;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>When we the errors of the virtuous state,                      </p>
<p>Then erring men their worth may emulate.</p>
<p class="i1">View then this picture of a noble mind:</p>
<p>Let him be wise, magnanimous, and kind;</p>
<p>What was the wisdom? Was it not the frown</p>
<p>That keeps all question, all inquiry down?</p>
<p>His words were powerful and decisive all;</p>
<p>But his slow reasons came for no man's call.</p>
<p>"'Tis thus," he cried, no doubt with kind intent,</p>
<p>To give results and spare all <span class="locked">argument.&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p class="i1">"Let it be spared&mdash;-all men at least agree        </p>
<p>Sir Denys Brand had magnanimity:</p>
<a name="Page_412" id="Page_412" class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</a>
<p>His were no vulgar charities; none saw</p>
<p>Him like the merchant to the hut withdraw;</p>
<p>He left to meaner minds the simple deed,</p>
<p>By which the houseless rest, the hungry feed;</p>
<p>His was a public bounty vast and grand;</p>
<p>'Twas not in him to work with viewless hand;</p>
<p>He raised the room that towers above the street,</p>
<p>A public room where grateful parties meet;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>He first the life-boat plann'd; to him the place               </p>
<p>Is deep in debt&mdash;'twas he reviv'd the race;</p>
<p>To every public act this hearty friend</p>
<p>Would give with freedom or with frankness lend;</p>
<p>His money built the jail, nor prisoner yet</p>
<p>Sits at his ease, but he must feel the debt;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>To these let candour add his vast display&mdash;               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Around his mansion all is grand and gay,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And this is bounty with the name of pay."                      </p>
<p class="i1">I grant the whole, nor from one deed retract,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>But wish recorded too the private act;                         </p>
<p>All these were great, but still our hearts approve</p>
<p>Those simpler tokens of the Christian love;</p>
<p>'Twould give me joy some gracious deed to meet,</p>
<p>That has not call'd for glory through the street.</p>
<p>Who felt for many, could not always shun,</p>
<p>In some soft moment, to be kind to one;</p>
<p>And yet they tell us, when Sir Denys died,</p>
<p>That not a widow in the Borough sigh'd;</p>
<p>Great were his gifts, his mighty heart I own,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>But why describe what all the world has known?                 </p>
<p class="i1">The rest is petty pride, the useless art</p>
<p>Of a vain mind to hide a swelling heart.</p>
<p>Small was his private room; men found him there</p>
<p>By a plain table, on a paltry chair;</p>
<p>A wretched floor-cloth, and some prints around,</p>
<p>The easy purchase of a single pound:</p>
<p>These humble trifles and that study small</p>
<p>Make a strong contrast with the servants' hall;</p>
<p>There barely comfort, here a proud excess,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>The pompous seat of pamper'd idleness,                         </p>
<p>Where the sleek rogues with one consent declare,</p>
<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413" class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</a>
<p>They would not live upon his honour's fare.</p>
<p>He daily took but one half-hour to dine,</p>
<p>On one poor dish and some three sips of wine;</p>
<p>Then he'd abuse them for their sumptuous feasts,</p>
<p>And say, "My friends! you make yourselves like beasts;</p>
<p>One dish suffices any man to dine,</p>
<p>But you are greedy as a herd of swine;</p>
<p>Learn to be temperate."&mdash;Had they dared t' obey,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>He would have praised and turn'd them all away.                </p>
<p class="i1">Friends met Sir Denys riding in his ground,</p>
<p>And there the meekness of his spirit found:</p>
<p>For that grey coat, not new for many a year,</p>
<p>Hides all that would like decent dress appear;</p>
<p>An old brown pony 'twas his will to ride,</p>
<p>Who shuffled onward, and from side to side;</p>
<p>A five-pound purchase, but so fat and sleek,</p>
<p>His very plenty made the creature weak.</p>
<p class="i1">"Sir Denys Brand! and on so poor a steed!<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>"Poor! it may be&mdash;such things I never heed:"                   </p>
<p>And who that youth behind, of pleasant mien,</p>
<p>Equipp'd as one who wishes to be seen,</p>
<p>Upon a horse, twice victor for a plate,</p>
<p>A noble hunter, bought at dearest rate?&mdash;</p>
<p>Him the lad, fearing, yet resolved to guide,</p>
<p>He curbs his spirit, while he strokes his pride.</p>
<p class="i1">"A handsome youth, Sir Denys; and a horse</p>
<p>Of finer figure never trod the <span class="locked">course&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yours, without question?"&mdash;"Yes! I think, a groom</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Bought me the beast; I cannot say the sum:                     </p>
<p>I ride him not, it is a foolish pride</p>
<p>Men have in cattle&mdash;but my people ride;</p>
<p>The boy is&mdash;hark ye, sirrah! what's your name?</p>
<p>Ay, Jacob, yes! I recollect&mdash;the same,</p>
<p>As I bethink me now, a tenant's <span class="locked">son&mdash;</span></p>
<p>I think a tenant&mdash;is your father one?"</p>
<p class="i1">There was an idle boy who ran about,</p>
<p>And found his master's humble spirit out;</p>
<p>He would at awful distance snatch a look,</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Then run away and hide him in some nook;                       </p>
<p>"For oh!" quoth he, "I dare not fix my sight</p>
<p>On him, his grandeur puts me in a fright;</p>
<p>Oh! Mister Jacob, when you wait on him,</p>
<a name="Page_414" id="Page_414" class="pagenum">[Pg 414]</a>
<p>Do you not quake and tremble every limb?"</p>
<p>The steward soon had orders&mdash;"Summers, see</p>
<p>That Sam be clothed, and let him wait on me."</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Sir Denys died, bequeathing all affairs</p>
<p>In trust to Laughton's long experienced cares,</p>
<p>Before a guardian; and, Sir Denys dead,</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>All rule and power devolved upon his head.                     </p>
<p>Numbers are call'd to govern, but in fact</p>
<p>Only the powerful and assuming act.</p>
<p class="i1">Laughton, too wise to be a dupe to fame,</p>
<p>Cared not a whit of what descent he came,</p>
<p>Till he was rich; he then conceived the thought</p>
<p>To fish for pedigree, but never caught.</p>
<p>All his desire, when he was young and poor,</p>
<p>Was to advance; he never cared for more:</p>
<p>"Let me buy, sell, be factor, take a wife,</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Take any road to get along in life."                           </p>
<p class="i1">Was he a miser then? a robber? foe</p>
<p>To those who trusted? a deceiver?&mdash;No!</p>
<p>He was ambitious; all his powers of mind</p>
<p>Were to one end controll'd, improved, combined;</p>
<p>Wit, learning, judgment, were, by his account,</p>
<p>Steps for the ladder he design'd to mount.</p>
<p>Such step was money: wealth was but his slave,</p>
<p>For power he gain'd it, and for power he gave;</p>
<p>Full well the Borough knows that he'd the art</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Of bringing money to the surest mart;                          </p>
<p>Friends too were aids, they led to certain ends,</p>
<p>Increase of power and claim on other friends.</p>
<p>A favourite step was marriage: then he gain'd</p>
<p>Seat in our hall, and o'er his party reign'd;</p>
<p>Houses and lands he bought, and long'd to buy,</p>
<p>But never drew the springs of purchase dry;</p>
<p>And thus at last they answer'd every call,</p>
<p>The failing found him ready for their fall.</p>
<p>He walks along the street, the mart, the quay,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>And looks and mutters, "This belongs to me."                   </p>
<a name="Page_415" id="Page_415" class="pagenum">[Pg 415]</a>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>His passions all partook the general bent;                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Interest inform'd him when he should resent,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>How long resist, and on what terms relent.                     </p>
<p>In points where he determined to succeed,</p>
<p>In vain might reason or compassion plead;</p>
<p>But gain'd his point, he was the best of men,</p>
<p>'Twas loss of time to be vexatious then:</p>
<p>Hence he was mild to all men whom he led,</p>
<p>Of all who dared resist the scourge and dread.</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p class="i1">Falsehood in him was not the useless lie         </p>
<p>Of boasting pride or laughing vanity;</p>
<p>It was the gainful, the persuading art,</p>
<p>That made its way and won the doubting heart,</p>
<p>Which argued, soften'd, humbled, and prevail'd;</p>
<p>Nor was it tried till ev'ry truth had fail'd;</p>
<p>No sage on earth could more than he despise</p>
<p>Degrading, poor, unprofitable lies.</p>
<p class="i1">Though fond of gain, and grieved by wanton waste,</p>
<p>To social parties he had no distaste;</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>With one presiding purpose in his view,                        </p>
<p>He sometimes could descend to trifle too!</p>
<p>Yet, in these moments, he had still the art</p>
<p>To ope the looks and close the guarded heart;</p>
<p>And, like the public host, has sometimes made</p>
<p>A grand repast, for which the guests have paid.</p>
<p class="i1">At length, with power endued and wealthy grown,</p>
<p>Frailties and passions, long suppressed, were shown;</p>
<p>Then, to provoke him was a dangerous thing;</p>
<p>His pride would punish, and his temper sting;</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>His powerful hatred sought th' avenging hour,                  </p>
<p>And his proud vengeance struck with all his <span class="locked">power&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Save when th' offender took a prudent way</p>
<p>The rising storm of fury to allay.</p>
<p>This might he do, and so in safety sleep,</p>
<p>By largely casting to the angry deep;</p>
<p>Or, better yet (its swelling force t' assuage,)</p>
<p>By pouring oil of flattery on its rage.</p>
<p class="i1">And now, of all the heart approved, possess'd,</p>
<p>Fear'd, favour'd, follow'd, dreaded, and caress'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>He gently yields to one mellifluous joy,                       </p>
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416" class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</a>
<p>The only sweet that is not found to cloy,</p>
<p>Bland adulation! Other pleasures pall</p>
<p>On the sick taste, and transient are they all;</p>
<p>But this one sweet has such enchanting power,</p>
<p>The more we take, the faster we devour;</p>
<p>Nauseous to those who must the dose apply,</p>
<p>And most disgusting to the standers-by;</p>
<p>Yet in all companies will Laughton feed,</p>
<p>Nor care how grossly men perform the deed.</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p class="i1">As gapes the nursling, or, what comes more near,     </p>
<p>Some Friendly-island chief, for hourly <span class="locked">cheer&mdash;</span></p>
<p>When wives and slaves, attending round his seat,</p>
<p>Prepare by turns the masticated meat:</p>
<p>So for this master, husband, parent, friend,</p>
<p>His ready slaves their various efforts blend,</p>
<p>And, to their lord still eagerly inclined,</p>
<p>Pour the crude trash of a dependent mind.</p>
<p class="i1">But let the muse assign the man his due;</p>
<p>Worth he possess'd, nor were his virtues <span class="locked">few;&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>He sometimes help'd the injured in their cause;                </p>
<p>His power and purse have back'd the failing laws;</p>
<p>He for religion has a due respect,</p>
<p>And all his serious notions are correct;</p>
<p>Although he pray'd and languished for a son,</p>
<p>He grew resigned when Heaven denied him one;</p>
<p>He never to this quiet mansion sends</p>
<p>Subject unfit, in compliment to friends.</p>
<p>Not so Sir Denys, who would yet protest</p>
<p>He always chose the worthiest and the best:</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Not men in trade by various loss brought down,                 </p>
<p>But those whose glory once amazed the town;</p>
<p>Who their last guinea in their pleasures spent,</p>
<p>Yet never fell so low as to repent;</p>
<p>To these his pity he could largely deal,</p>
<p>Wealth they had known, and therefore want could feel.</p>
<p class="i1">Three seats were vacant while Sir Denys reign'd,</p>
<p>And three such favourites their admission gain'd;</p>
<p>These let us view, still more to understand</p>
<p>The moral feelings of Sir Denys Brand.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XIV.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">LIFE OF BLANEY.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<p>Observe that tall pale veteran! what a look</p>
<p>Of shame and guilt! who cannot read that book?</p>
<p>Misery and mirth are blended in his face,</p>
<p>Much innate vileness and some outward grace;</p>
<p>There wishes strong and stronger griefs are seen,</p>
<p>Looks ever changed, and never one serene:</p>
<p>Show not that manner, and these features all,</p>
<p>The serpent's cunning and the sinner's fall?</p>
<p class="i1">Hark to that laughter!&mdash;'tis the way he takes</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>To force applause for each vile jest he makes;                  </p>
<p>Such is yon man, by partial favour sent</p>
<p>To these calm seats to ponder and repent.</p>
<p class="i1">Blaney, a wealthy heir at twenty-one,</p>
<p>At twenty-five was ruin'd and undone:</p>
<p>These years with grievous crimes we need not load,</p>
<p>He found his ruin in the common <span class="locked">road;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Gamed without skill, without inquiry bought,</p>
<p>Lent without love, and borrowed without thought.</p>
<p>But, gay and handsome, he had soon the dower</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Of a kind wealthy widow in his power;                           </p>
<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419" class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</a>
<p>Then he aspired to loftier flights of vice,</p>
<p>To singing harlots of enormous price;</p>
<p>He took a jockey in his gig to buy</p>
<p>A horse, so valued that a duke was shy;</p>
<p>To gain the plaudits of the knowing few,</p>
<p>Gamblers and grooms, what would not Blaney do?</p>
<p>His dearest friend, at that improving age,</p>
<p>Was Hounslow Dick, who drove the western stage.</p>
<p class="i1">Cruel he was not.&mdash;If he left his wife,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>He left her to her own pursuits in life;                        </p>
<p>Deaf to reports, to all expenses blind;</p>
<p>Profuse, not just, and careless, but not kind.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet, thus assisted, ten long winters pass'd</p>
<p>In wasting guineas ere he saw his last;</p>
<p>Then he began to reason, and to feel</p>
<p>He could not dig, nor had he learn'd to steal;</p>
<p>And should he beg as long as he might live,</p>
<p>He justly fear'd that nobody would give.</p>
<p>But he could charge a pistol, and, at will,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>All that was mortal by a bullet kill:                           </p>
<p>And he was taught, by those whom he would call</p>
<p>Man's surest guides&mdash;that he was mortal all.</p>
<p class="i1">While thus he thought, still waiting for the day,</p>
<p>When he should dare to blow his brains away,</p>
<p>A place for him a kind relation found,</p>
<p>Where England's monarch ruled, but far from English ground;</p>
<p>He gave employ that might for bread suffice,</p>
<p>Correct his habits and restrain his vice.</p>
<p class="i1">Here Blaney tried (what such man's miseries teach)</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>To find what pleasures were within his reach;                   </p>
<p>These he enjoy'd, though not in just the style</p>
<p>He once possess'd them in his native isle;</p>
<p>Congenial souls he found in every place,</p>
<p>Vice in all soils, and charms in every race:</p>
<p>His lady took the same amusing way,</p>
<p>And laugh'd at Time till he had turn'd them grey:</p>
<p>At length for England once again they steer'd,</p>
<p>By ancient views and new designs endear'd;</p>
<p>His kindred died, and Blaney now became</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>An heir to one who never heard his name.                        </p>
<a name="Page_420" id="Page_420" class="pagenum">[Pg 420]</a>
<p class="i1">What could he now?&mdash;The man had tried before</p>
<p>The joys of youth, and they were joys no more;</p>
<p>To vicious pleasure he was still inclined,</p>
<p>But vice must now be season'd and refined;</p>
<p><i>Then</i> as a swine he would on pleasure seize,</p>
<p>Now common pleasures had no power to please:</p>
<p>Beauty alone has for the vulgar charms,</p>
<p>He wanted beauty trembling with alarms;</p>
<p>His was no more a youthful dream of joy,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>The wretch desired to ruin and destroy;                         </p>
<p>He bought indulgence with a boundless price,</p>
<p>Most pleased when decency bow'd down to vice,</p>
<p>When a fair dame her husband's honour sold,</p>
<p>And a frail Countess play'd for Blaney's gold.</p>
<p class="i1">"But did not conscience in her anger rise?"</p>
<p>Yes! and he learn'd her terrors to despise;</p>
<p>When stung by thought, to soothing books he fled,</p>
<p>And grew composed and hardened as he read;</p>
<p>Tales of Voltaire, and essays gay and slight,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Pleased him and shone with their phosphoric light;              </p>
<p>Which, though it rose from objects vile and base,</p>
<p>Where'er it came threw splendour on the place,</p>
<p>And was that light which the deluded youth,</p>
<p>And this grey sinner, deem'd the light of truth.</p>
<p class="i1">He different works for different cause <span class="locked">admired&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Some fix'd his judgment, some his passions fired;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>To cheer the mind and raise a dormant flame,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>He had the books, decreed to lasting shame,               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Which those who read are careful not to name:                  </p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>These won to vicious act the yielding heart,                    </p>
<p>And then the cooler reasoners soothed the smart.</p>
<p class="i1">He heard of Blount, and Mandeville, and Chubb,</p>
<p>How they the doctors of their day would drub;</p>
<p>How Hume had dwelt on miracles so well,</p>
<p>That none would now believe a miracle;</p>
<p>And though he cared not works so grave to read,</p>
<p>He caught their faith and sign'd the sinner's creed.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus was he pleased to join the laughing side;</p>
<p>Nor ceased the laughter when his lady died.</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Yet was he kind and careful of her fame,                       </p>
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421" class="pagenum">[Pg 421]</a>
<p>And on her tomb inscribed a virtuous name:</p>
<p>"A tender wife, respected, and so <span class="locked">forth."&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The marble still bears witness to the worth.</p>
<p class="i1">He has some children, but he knows not where;</p>
<p>Something they cost, but neither love nor care;</p>
<p>A father's feelings he has never known,</p>
<p>His joys, his sorrows, have been all his own.</p>
<p class="i1">He now would build&mdash;and lofty seat he built,</p>
<p>And sought, in various ways, relief from guilt.</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Restless, for ever anxious to obtain                           </p>
<p>Ease for the heart by ramblings of the brain,</p>
<p>He would have pictures, and of course a taste,</p>
<p>And found a thousand means his wealth to waste.</p>
<p>Newmarket steeds he bought at mighty cost;</p>
<p>They sometimes won, but Blaney always lost.</p>
<p class="i1">Quick came his ruin, came when he had still</p>
<p>For life a relish, and in pleasure skill:</p>
<p>By his own idle reckoning he supposed</p>
<p>His wealth would last him till his life was closed;</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>But no! he found his final hoard was spent,                    </p>
<p>While he had years to suffer and repent.</p>
<p>Yet at the last, his noble mind to show,</p>
<p>And in his misery how he bore the blow,</p>
<p>He view'd his only guinea, then suppress'd</p>
<p>For a short time, the tumults in his breast,</p>
<p>And, moved by pride, by habit and despair,</p>
<p>Gave it an opera-bird to hum an air.</p>
<p class="i1">Come ye! who live for pleasure, come, behold</p>
<p>A man of pleasure when he's poor and old;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>When he looks back through life, and cannot find               </p>
<p>A single action to relieve his mind;</p>
<p>When he looks forward, striving still to keep</p>
<p>A steady prospect of eternal sleep;</p>
<p>When not one friend is left, of all the train</p>
<p>Whom 'twas his pride and boast to <span class="locked">entertain&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Friends now employ'd from house to house to run</p>
<p>And say, "Alas! poor Blaney is undone!<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Those whom he shook with ardour by the hand,</p>
<p>By whom he stood as long as he could stand,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Who seem'd to him from all deception clear,                    </p>
<a name="Page_422" id="Page_422" class="pagenum">[Pg 422]</a>
<p>And who, more strange! might think themselves sincere.</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! now the hero shuffling through the town,</p>
<p>To hunt a dinner and to beg a crown;</p>
<p>To tell an idle tale, that boys may smile;</p>
<p>To bear a strumpet's billet-doux a mile;</p>
<p>To cull a wanton for a youth of wealth,</p>
<p>(With [reverent] view to both his taste and health);</p>
<p>To be a useful, needy thing between</p>
<p>Fear and desire&mdash;the pander and the screen;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>To flatter pictures, houses, horses, dress,                    </p>
<p>The wildest fashion or the worst excess;</p>
<p>To be the grey seducer, and entice</p>
<p>Unbearded folly into acts of vice;</p>
<p>And then, to level every fence which law</p>
<p>And virtue fix to keep the mind in awe,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>

<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Next prompts and soothes them in their fatal way,         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Then vindicates the deed, and makes the mind his prey.         </p>
<p class="i1">Unhappy man! what pains he takes to state</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>(Proof of his fear!) that all below is fate;                   </p>
<p>That all proceed in one appointed track,</p>
<p>Where none can stop, or take their journey back!</p>
<p>Then what is vice or virtue?&mdash;Yet he'll rail</p>
<p>At priests till memory and quotation fail;</p>
<p>He reads, to learn the various ills they've done,</p>
<p>And calls them vipers, every mother's son.</p>
<p class="i1">He is the harlot's aid, who wheedling tries</p>
<p>To move her friend for vanity's supplies;</p>
<p>To weak indulgence he allures the mind,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Loth to be duped, but willing to be kind;                      </p>
<p>And if successful&mdash;what the labour pays?</p>
<p>He gets the friend's contempt and Chloe's praise,</p>
<p>Who, in her triumph, condescends to say,</p>
<p>"What a good creature Blaney was to-day!"</p>
<p class="i1">Hear the poor dæmon when the young attend,</p>
<p>And willing ear to vile experience lend;</p>
<p>When he relates (with laughing, leering eye)</p>
<p>The tale licentious, mix'd with blasphemy:</p>
<p>No genuine gladness his narrations cause,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>The frailest heart denies sincere applause;                    </p>
<a name="Page_423" id="Page_423" class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</a>
<p>And many a youth has turn'd him half aside,</p>
<p>And laugh'd aloud, the sign of shame to hide.</p>
<p class="i1">Blaney, no aid in his vile cause to lose,</p>
<p>Buys pictures, prints, and a licentious muse;</p>
<p>He borrows every help from every art,</p>
<p>To stir the passions and mislead the heart.</p>
<p>But from the subject let us soon escape,</p>
<p>Nor give this feature all its ugly shape:</p>
<p>Some to their crimes escape from satire owe;</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Who shall describe what Blaney dares to show?                  </p>
<p class="i1">While thus the man, to vice and passion slave,</p>
<p>Was, with his follies, moving to the grave,</p>
<p>The ancient ruler of this mansion died,</p>
<p>And Blaney boldly for the seat applied.</p>
<p>Sir Denys Brand, then guardian, join'd his suit;</p>
<p>"'Tis true," said he, "the fellow's quite a <span class="locked">brute&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A very beast; but yet, with all his sin,</p>
<p>He has a manner&mdash;let the devil in."</p>
<p class="i1">They half complied, they gave the wish'd retreat,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>But raised a worthier to the vacant seat.                      </p>
<p class="i1">Thus forced on ways unlike each former way,</p>
<p>Thus led to prayer without a heart to pray,</p>
<p>He quits the gay and rich, the young and free,</p>
<p>Among the badge-men with a badge to be.</p>
<p>He sees an humble tradesman raised to rule</p>
<p>The grey-beard pupils of this moral school;</p>
<p>Where he himself, an old licentious boy,</p>
<p>Will nothing learn, and nothing can enjoy;</p>
<p>In temp'rate measures he must eat and drink,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>And, pain of pains! must live alone and think.                 </p>
<p class="i1">In vain, by fortune's smiles, thrice affluent made,</p>
<p>Still has he debts of ancient date unpaid;</p>
<p>Thrice into penury by error thrown,</p>
<p>Not one right maxim has he made his own;</p>
<p>The old men shun him&mdash;some his vices hate,</p>
<p>And all abhor his principles and prate;</p>
<p>Nor love nor care for him will mortal show,</p>
<p>Save a frail sister in the female row.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XV.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">CLELIA.</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>We had a sprightly nymph&mdash;in every town</p>
<p>Are some such sprights, who wander up and down;</p>
<p>She had her useful arts, and could contrive,</p>
<p>In time's despite, to stay at twenty-<span class="locked">five;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Here will I rest; move on, thou lying year,</p>
<p>This is mine age, and I will rest me here."</p>
<p class="i1">Arch was her look, and she had pleasant ways</p>
<p>Your good opinion of her heart to raise;</p>
<p>Her speech was lively, and with ease express'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>And well she judged the tempers she address'd:                  </p>
<p>If some soft stripling had her keenness felt,</p>
<p>She knew the way to make his anger melt;</p>
<p>Wit was allow'd her, though but few could bring</p>
<p>Direct example of a witty thing;</p>
<p>'Twas that gay, pleasant, smart, engaging speech,</p>
<p>Her beaux admired, and just within their reach;</p>
<p>Not indiscreet, perhaps, but yet more free</p>
<p>Than prudish nymphs allow their wit to be.</p>
<p class="i1">Novels and plays, with poems, old and new,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Were all the books our nymph attended to;                       </p>
<p>Yet from the press no treatise issued forth,</p>
<p>But she would speak precisely of its worth.</p>
<p class="i1">She with the London stage familiar grew,</p>
<a name="Page_426" id="Page_426" class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</a>
<p>And every actor's name and merit knew;</p>
<p>She told how this or that their part mistook,</p>
<p>And of the rival Romeos gave the look;</p>
<p>Of either house 'twas hers the strength to see,</p>
<p>Then judge with candour&mdash;"Drury-Lane for me."</p>
<p class="i1">What made this knowledge, what this skill complete?</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>A fortnight's visit in Whitechapel-street.                      </p>
<p class="i1">Her place in life was rich and poor between,</p>
<p>With those a favourite, and with these a queen;</p>
<p>She could her parts assume, and condescend</p>
<p>To friends more humble while an humble friend;</p>
<p>And thus a welcome, lively guest could pass,</p>
<p>Threading her pleasant way from class to class.</p>
<p class="i1">"Her reputation?"&mdash;That was like her wit,</p>
<p>And seem'd her manner and her state to fit;</p>
<p>Something there was&mdash;what, none presumed to say:</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day&mdash;                       </p>
<p>Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear,</p>
<p>And mix'd reports no judge on earth could clear.</p>
<p class="i1">But of each sex a friendly number press'd</p>
<p>To joyous banquets this alluring guest.</p>
<p>There, if, indulging mirth and freed from awe,</p>
<p>If, pleasing all and pleased with all she saw,</p>
<p>Her speech were free, and such as freely dwelt</p>
<p>On the same feelings all around her felt;</p>
<p>Or if some fond presuming favourite tried</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>To come so near as once to be denied;                           </p>
<p>Yet not with brow so stern or speech so nice,</p>
<p>But that he ventured on denial <span class="locked">twice:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>If these have been, and so has scandal taught,</p>
<p>Yet malice never found the proof she sought.</p>
<p class="i1">But then came one, the Lovelace of his day,</p>
<p>Rich, proud, and crafty, handsome, brave, and gay;</p>
<p>Yet loved he not those labour'd plans and arts,</p>
<p>But left the business to the ladies' hearts,</p>
<p>And, when he found them in a proper train,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>He thought all else superfluous and vain.                       </p>
<p>But in that training he was deeply taught,</p>
<p>And rarely fail'd of gaining all he sought;</p>
<p>He knew how far directly on to go;</p>
<a name="Page_427" id="Page_427" class="pagenum">[Pg 427]</a>
<p>How to recede and dally to and fro;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>How to make all the passions his allies,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And, when he saw them in contention rise,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>To watch the wrought-up heart, and conquer by surprise.        </p>
<p class="i1">Our heroine fear'd him not; it was her part,</p>
<p>To make sure conquest of such gentle <span class="locked">heart&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Of one so mild and humble; for she saw                          </p>
<p>In Henry's eye a love chastised by awe.</p>
<p>Her thoughts of virtue were not all sublime,</p>
<p>Nor virtuous all her thoughts; 'twas now her time</p>
<p>To bait each hook, in every way to please,</p>
<p>And the rich prize with dext'rous hand to seize.</p>
<p>She had no virgin-terrors; she could stray</p>
<p>In all love's maze, nor fear to lose her way;</p>
<p>Nay, could go near the precipice, nor dread</p>
<p>A failing caution or a giddy head;</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>She'd fix her eyes upon the roaring flood,                      </p>
<p>And dance upon the brink where danger stood.</p>
<p class="i1">'Twas nature all, she judged, in one so young,</p>
<p>To drop the eye and falter in the tongue;</p>
<p>To be about to take, and then command</p>
<p>His daring wish, and only view the hand:</p>
<p>Yes! all was nature; it became a maid</p>
<p>Of gentle soul t' encourage love <span class="locked">afraid.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He, so unlike the confident and bold,</p>
<p>Would fly in mute despair to find her cold:</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>The young and tender germ requires the sun                      </p>
<p>To make it spread; it must be smiled upon.</p>
<p>Thus the kind virgin gentle means devised</p>
<p>To gain a heart so fond, a hand so prized;</p>
<p>More gentle still she grew; to change her way</p>
<p>Would cause confusion, danger and delay:</p>
<p>Thus, (an increase of gentleness her mode,)</p>
<p>She took a plain, unvaried, certain road,</p>
<p>And every hour believed success was near,</p>
<p>Till there was nothing left to hope or fear.</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p class="i1">It must be own'd that in this strife of hearts,     </p>
<p>Man has advantage&mdash;has superior arts.</p>
<p>The lover's aim is to the nymph unknown,</p>
<p>Nor is she always certain of her own;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Or has her fears, nor these can so disguise,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>But he who searches, reads them in her eyes,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<a name="Page_428" id="Page_428" class="pagenum">[Pg 428]</a>
<p>In the avenging frown, in the regretting sighs:                </p>
<p>These are his signals, and he learns to steer</p>
<p>The straighter course whenever they appear.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Pass we ten years, and what was Clelia's fate?"</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>At an attorney's board alert she sate,                         </p>
<p>Not legal mistress: he with other men</p>
<p>Once sought her hand, but other views were then;</p>
<p>And when he knew he might the bliss command,</p>
<p>He other [blessing] sought, without the hand;</p>
<p>For still he felt alive the lambent flame,</p>
<p>And offer'd her a home&mdash;and home she came.</p>
<p class="i1">There, though her higher friendships lived no more,</p>
<p>She loved to speak of what she shared <span class="locked">before&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>"Of the dear Lucy, heiress of the hall&mdash;                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Of good Sir Peter&mdash;of their annual ball,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And the fair countess!&mdash;Oh! she loved them all!"               </p>
<p>The humbler clients of her friend would stare,</p>
<p>The knowing smile&mdash;but neither caused her care;</p>
<p>She brought her spirits to her humble state,</p>
<p>And soothed with idle dreams her frowning fate.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Ten summers pass'd, and how was Clelia then?"</p>
<p>Alas! she suffer'd in this trying ten;</p>
<p>The pair had parted: who to him attend,</p>
<p>Must judge the nymph unfaithful to her friend;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>But who on her would equal faith bestow,                       </p>
<p>Would think him rash&mdash;and surely she must know.</p>
<p class="i1">Then as a matron Clelia taught a school,</p>
<p>But nature gave not talents fit for rule.</p>
<p>Yet now, though marks of wasting years were seen,</p>
<p>Some touch of sorrow, some attack of spleen;</p>
<p>Still there was life, a spirit quick and gay,</p>
<p>And lively speech and elegant array.</p>
<p class="i1">The Griffin's landlord these allured so far,</p>
<p>He made her mistress of his heart and bar;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>He had no idle retrospective whim,                             </p>
<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429" class="pagenum">[Pg 429]</a>
<p>Till she was his, her deeds concern'd not him.</p>
<p>So far was well,&mdash;but Clelia thought not fit</p>
<p>(In all the Griffin needed) to submit:</p>
<p>Gaily to dress and in the bar preside,</p>
<p>Soothed the poor spirit of degraded pride;</p>
<p>But cooking, waiting, welcoming a crew</p>
<p>Of noisy guests, were arts she never knew:</p>
<p>Hence daily wars, with temporary truce,</p>
<p>His vulgar insult, and her keen abuse;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>And as their spirits wasted in the strife,                     </p>
<p>Both took the Griffin's ready aid of life;</p>
<p>But she with greater prudence&mdash;Harry tried</p>
<p>More powerful aid, and in the trial died;</p>
<p>Yet drew down vengeance: in no distant time,</p>
<p>Th' insolvent Griffin struck his wings <span class="locked">sublime;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Forth from her palace walk'd th' ejected queen,</p>
<p>And show'd to frowning fate a look serene;</p>
<p>Gay spite of time, though poor, yet well attired,</p>
<p>Kind without love, and vain if not admired.</p>
</div>

<hr class="hr45" />

<div class="stanza">
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p class="i1">Another term is past; ten other years          </p>
<p>In various trials, troubles, views, and fears.</p>
<p>Of these some pass'd in small attempts at trade;</p>
<p>Houses she kept for widowers lately made;</p>
<p>For now she said, "They'll miss th' endearing friend,</p>
<p>And I'll be there the soften'd heart to bend."</p>
<p>And true a part was done as Clelia <span class="locked">plann'd&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The heart was soften'd, but she miss'd the hand.</p>
<p>She wrote a novel, and Sir Denys said,</p>
<p>The dedication was the best he read;</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>But Edgeworths, Smiths, and Radcliffes so engross'd            </p>
<p>The public ear, that all her pains were lost.</p>
<p>To keep a toy-shop was attempt the last,</p>
<p>There too she fail'd, and schemes and hopes were past.</p>
<p class="i1">Now friendless, sick and old, and wanting bread,</p>
<p>The first-born tears of fallen pride were <span class="locked">shed&mdash;</span></p>
<p>True, bitter tears; and yet that wounded pride,</p>
<p>Among the poor, for poor distinctions sigh'd.</p>
<p>Though now her tales were to her audience fit;</p>
<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430" class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</a>
<p>Though loud her tones, and vulgar grown her wit;</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Though now her dress&mdash;(but let me not explain                  </p>
<p>The piteous patch-work of the needy-vain,</p>
<p>The flirtish form to coarse materials lent,</p>
<p>And one poor robe through fifty fashions sent;)</p>
<p>Though all within was sad, without was <span class="locked">mean&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Still 'twas her wish, her comfort to be seen:</p>
<p>She would to plays on lowest terms resort,</p>
<p>Where once her box was to the beaux a court;</p>
<p>And, strange delight! to that same house where she</p>
<p>Join'd in the dance, all gaiety and glee,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Now, with the menials crowding to the wall,                    </p>
<p>She'd see, not share, the pleasures of the ball,</p>
<p>And with degraded vanity unfold,</p>
<p>How she too triumphed in the years of old.</p>
<p>To her poor friends 'tis now her pride to tell</p>
<p>On what a height she stood before she fell;</p>
<p>At church she points to one tall seat, and "There</p>
<p>We sat," she cries, "when my papa was mayor."</p>
<p>Not quite correct in what she now relates,</p>
<p>She alters persons, and she forges dates;</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And, finding memory's weaker help decay'd,                     </p>
<p>She boldly calls invention to her aid.</p>
<p class="i1">Touch'd by the pity he had felt before,</p>
<p>For her Sir Denys op'd the alms-house door.</p>
<p>"With all her faults," he said, "the woman knew</p>
<p>How to distinguish&mdash;had a manner too;</p>
<p>And, as they say she is allied to some</p>
<p>In decent station&mdash;let the creature come."</p>
<p class="i1">Here she and Blaney meet, and take their view</p>
<p>Of all the pleasures they would still pursue.</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Hour after hour they sit, and nothing hide                     </p>
<p>Of vices past; their follies are their pride;</p>
<p>What to the sober and the cool are crimes,</p>
<p>They boast&mdash;exulting in those happy times;</p>
<p>The darkest deeds no indignation raise,</p>
<p>The purest virtue never wins their praise;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>But still they on their ancient joys dilate,              </p>

<p>Still with regret departed glories state,                 </p>

<p>In its due place, the rich effulgence shone.</p>
<p>But this strange fire the seat of peace invades,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>And shines portentous in these solemn shades.                   </p>
<p class="i1">Benbow, a boon companion, long approved</p>
<p>By jovial sets, and (as he thought) beloved,</p>
<p>Was judged as one to joy and friendship prone,</p>
<p>And deem'd injurious to himself alone;</p>
<p>Gen'rous and free, he paid but small regard</p>
<p>To trade, and fail'd; and some declared "'twas hard."</p>
<p>These were his friends&mdash;his foes conceived the case</p>
<p>Of common kind; he sought and found disgrace;</p>
<a name="Page_433" id="Page_433" class="pagenum">[Pg 433]</a>
<p>The reasoning few, who neither scorn'd nor loved,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>His feelings pitied and his faults reproved.                    </p>
<p class="i1">Benbow, the father, left possessions fair,</p>
<p>A worthy name and business to his heir;</p>
<p>Benbow, the son, those fair possessions sold,</p>
<p>And lost his credit, while he spent the gold.</p>
<p>He was a jovial trader: men enjoy'd</p>
<p>The night with him; his day was unemploy'd;</p>
<p>So, when his credit and his cash were spent,</p>
<p>Here, by mistaken pity, he was sent;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Of late he came, with passions unsubdued,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>And shared and cursed the hated solitude,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Where gloomy thoughts arise, where grievous cares intrude.     </p>
<p class="i1">Known but in drink&mdash;he found an easy friend,</p>
<p>Well pleased his worth and honour to commend;</p>
<p>And, thus inform'd, the guardian of the trust</p>
<p>Heard the applause and said the claim was just;</p>
<p>A worthy soul! unfitted for the strife,</p>
<p>Care and contention of a busy <span class="locked">life;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Worthy, and why?&mdash;that o'er the midnight bowl</p>
<p>He made his friend the partner of his soul,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And any man his friend;&mdash;then thus in glee,                     </p>
<p>"I speak my mind; I love the truth," quoth he;</p>
<p>Till 'twas his fate that useful truth to find,</p>
<p>'Tis sometimes prudent not to speak the mind.</p>
<p class="i1">With wine inflated, man is all upblown,</p>
<p>And feels a power which he believes his own;</p>
<p>With fancy soaring to the skies, he thinks</p>
<p>His all the virtues all the while he drinks;</p>
<p>But when the gas from the balloon is gone,</p>
<p>When sober thoughts and serious cares come on,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Where then the worth that in himself he found?&mdash;                </p>
<p>Vanish'd&mdash;and he sank grov'ling on the ground.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">Still some conceit will Benbow's mind inflate;    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Poor as he is&mdash;'tis pleasant to relate                         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The joys he once possess'd: it soothes his present state.      </p>
<p class="i1">Seated with some grey beadsman, he regrets</p>
<p>His former feasting, though it swell'd his debts;</p>
<p>Topers once famed, his friends in earlier days,</p>
<p>Well he describes, and thinks description praise:</p>
<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434" class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</a>
<p>Each hero's worth with much delight he paints;</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Martyrs they were, and he would make them saints.               </p>
<p class="i1">"Alas! alas!" Old England now may say,</p>
<p>"My glory withers; it has had its day:</p>
<p>We're fallen on evil times; men read and think;</p>
<p>Our bold forefathers loved to fight and drink.</p>
<p class="i1">"Then lived the good 'Squire Asgill&mdash;what a change</p>
<p>Has death and fashion shown us at the Grange!</p>
<p>He bravely thought it best became his rank,</p>
<p>That all his tenants and his tradesmen drank;</p>
<p>He was delighted from his favourite room</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>To see them 'cross the park go daily home,                      </p>
<p>Praising aloud the liquor and the host,</p>
<p>And striving who should venerate him most.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"No pride had he, and there was difference small   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Between the master's and the servants' hall;                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And here or there the guests were welcome all.                 </p>
<p>Of Heaven's free gifts he took no special care;</p>
<p>He never quarrel'd for a simple hare;</p>
<p>But sought, by giving sport, a sportsman's name,</p>
<p>Himself a poacher, though at other game.</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>He never planted nor inclosed&mdash;his trees                        </p>
<p>Grew like himself, untroubled and at ease;</p>
<p>Bounds of all kinds he hated, and had felt</p>
<p>Choked and imprison'd in a modern belt,</p>
<p>Which some rare genius now has twined about</p>
<p>The good old house, to keep old neighbours out;</p>
<p>Along his valleys, in the evening hours,</p>
<p>The borough-damsels stray'd to gather flowers,</p>
<p>Or by the brakes and brushwood of the park,</p>
<p>To take their pleasant rambles in the dark.</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p class="i1">"Some prudes, of rigid kind, forbore to call       </p>
<p>On the kind females&mdash;favourites at the hall;</p>
<p>But better natures saw, with much delight,</p>
<p>The different orders of mankind unite;</p>
<p>'Twas schooling pride to see the footman wait,</p>
<p>Smile on his sister and receive her plate.</p>
<p class="i1">"His worship ever was a churchman true,</p>
<p>He held in scorn the methodistic crew;</p>
<p>'May God defend the Church, and save the King,'</p>
<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435" class="pagenum">[Pg 435]</a>
<p>He'd pray devoutly and divinely sing.</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Admit that he the holy day would spend                         </p>
<p>As priests approved not&mdash;still he was a friend.</p>
<p>Much then I blame the preacher, as too nice,</p>
<p>To call such trifles by the name of vice,</p>
<p>Hinting, though gently and with cautious speech,</p>
<p>Of good example&mdash;'tis their trade to preach;</p>
<p>But still 'twas pity, when the worthy 'squire</p>
<p>Stuck to the church: what more could they require?</p>
<p>'Twas almost joining that fanatic crew,</p>
<p>To throw such morals at his honour's pew;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>A weaker man, had he been so reviled,                          </p>
<p>Had left the place&mdash;he only swore and smiled.</p>
<p class="i1">"But think, ye rectors and ye curates, think,</p>
<p>Who are your friends, and at their frailties wink;</p>
<p>Conceive not&mdash;mounted on your Sunday-throne,</p>
<p>Your fire-brands fall upon your foes alone;</p>
<p>They strike your patrons&mdash;and, should all withdraw</p>
<p>In whom your wisdoms may discern a flaw,</p>
<p>You would the flower of all your audience lose,</p>
<p>And spend your crackers on their empty pews,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i1">"The father dead, the son has found a wife,       </p>
<p>And lives a formal, proud, unsocial <span class="locked">life;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The lands are now enclosed; the tenants all,</p>
<p>Save at a rent-day, never see the hall;</p>
<p>No lass is suffer'd o'er the walks to come,</p>
<p>And, if there's love, they have it all at home.</p>
<p class="i1">"Oh! could the ghost of our good 'squire arise,</p>
<p>And see such change, would it believe its eyes?</p>
<p>Would it not glide about from place to place,</p>
<p>And mourn the manners of a feebler race?</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>At that long table, where the servants found                   </p>
<p>Mirth and abundance while the year went round;</p>
<p>Where a huge pollard on the winter-fire</p>
<p>At a huge distance made them all retire;</p>
<p>Where not a measure in the room was kept,</p>
<p>And but one rule&mdash;they tippled till they slept:</p>
<p>There would it see a pale old hag preside,</p>
<p>A thing made up of stinginess and pride;</p>
<p>Who carves the meat, as if the flesh could feel,</p>
<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436" class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</a>
<p>Careless whose flesh must miss the plenteous meal.</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Here would the ghost a small coal-fire behold,                 </p>
<p>Not fit to keep one body from the cold;</p>
<p>Then would it flit to higher rooms, and stay</p>
<p>To view a dull, dress'd company at play;</p>
<p>All the old comfort, all the genial fare</p>
<p>For ever gone! how sternly would it stare;</p>
<p>And, though it might not to their view appear,</p>
<p>'Twould cause among them lassitude and fear;</p>
<p>Then wait to see&mdash;where he delight has <span class="locked">seen&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The dire effect of fretfulness and spleen.</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p class="i1">"Such were the worthies of these better days;      </p>
<p>We had their blessings&mdash;they shall have our <span class="locked">praise.&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Of Captain Dowling would you hear me speak?</p>
<p>I'd sit and sing his praises for a week:</p>
<p>He was a man, and man-like all his <span class="locked">joy,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>I'm led to question, was he ever boy?</p>
<p>Beef was his breakfast;&mdash;if from sea and salt,</p>
<p>It relish'd better with his wine of malt;</p>
<p>Then, till he dined, if walking in or out,</p>
<p>Whether the gravel teased him or the gout,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Though short in wind and flannel'd every limb,                 </p>
<p>He drank with all who had concerns with him:</p>
<p>Whatever trader, agent, merchant, came,</p>
<p>They found him ready, every hour the same;</p>
<p>Whatever liquors might between them pass,</p>
<p>He took them all, and never balk'd his glass;</p>
<p>Nay, with the seamen working in the ship,</p>
<p>At their request, he'd share the grog and flip.</p>
<p>But in the club-room was his chief delight,</p>
<p>And punch the favourite liquor of the night;</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Man after man they from the trial shrank,                      </p>
<p>And Dowling ever was the last who drank.</p>
<p>Arrived at home, he, ere he sought his bed,</p>
<p>With pipe and brandy would compose his head;</p>
<p>Then half an hour was o'er the news beguiled,</p>
<p>When he retired as harmless as a child.</p>
<p>Set but aside the gravel and the gout,</p>
<p>And breathing short&mdash;his sand ran fairly out.</p>
<p class="i1">"At fifty-five we lost him&mdash;after that</p>
<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437" class="pagenum">[Pg 437]</a>
<p>Life grows insipid and its pleasures flat;</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>He had indulged in all that man can have,                      </p>
<p>He did not drop a dotard to his grave;</p>
<p>Still to the last, his feet upon the chair,</p>
<p>With rattling lungs now gone beyond repair;</p>
<p>When on each feature death had fix'd his stamp,</p>
<p>And not a doctor could the body vamp;</p>
<p>Still at the last, to his beloved bowl</p>
<p>He clung, and cheer'd the sadness of his soul;</p>
<p>For, though a man may not have much to fear,</p>
<p>Yet death looks ugly, when the view is near.</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>&mdash;'I go,' he said, 'but still my friends shall say,            </p>
<p>'Twas as a man&mdash;I did not sneak away;</p>
<p>An honest life with worthy souls I've <span class="locked">spent&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Come, fill my glass;'&mdash;he took it, and he <span class="locked">went.&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">"Poor Dolly Murrey!&mdash;I might live to see</p>
<p>My hundredth year, but no such lass as she.</p>
<p>Easy by nature, in her humour gay,</p>
<p>She chose her comforts, ratafia and play:</p>
<p>She loved the social game, the decent glass;</p>
<p>And was a jovial, friendly, laughing lass.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>We sat not then at Whist demure and still,                     </p>
<p>But pass'd the pleasant hours at gay Quadrille;</p>
<p>Lame in her side, we placed her in her seat,</p>
<p>Her hands were free, she cared not for her feet;</p>
<p>As the game ended, came the glass around,</p>
<p>(So was the loser cheer'd, the winner crown'd.)</p>
<p>Mistress of secrets, both the young and old</p>
<p>In her confided&mdash;not a tale she told;</p>
<p>Love never made impression on her mind,</p>
<p>She held him weak, and all his captives blind;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>She suffered no man her free soul to vex,                      </p>
<p>Free from the weakness of her gentle sex;</p>
<p>One with whom ours unmoved conversing sate,</p>
<p>In cool discussion or in free debate.</p>
<p class="i1">"Once in her chair we'd placed the good old lass,</p>
<p>Where first she took her preparation glass;</p>
<p>By lucky thought she'd been that day at prayers,</p>
<p>And long before had fix'd her small affairs;</p>
<p>So all was easy&mdash;on her cards she cast</p>
<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438" class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</a>
<p>A smiling look; I saw the thought that pass'd:</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>'A king,' she call'd;&mdash;though conscious of her skill,          </p>
<p>'Do more,' I answer'd&mdash;'More?' she said; 'I will;'</p>
<p>And more she did&mdash;cards answer'd to her call,</p>
<p>She saw the mighty to her mightier fall:</p>
<p>'A vole! a vole!' she cried, ''tis fairly won,</p>
<p>My game is ended and my work is <span class="locked">done.'&mdash;</span></p>
<p>This said, she gently, with a single sigh,</p>
<p>Died as one taught and practised how to die.</p>
<p class="i1">"Such were the dead-departed; I survive,</p>
<p>To breathe in pain among the dead-alive."</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p class="i1">The bell then call'd these ancient men to pray;     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>"Again!" said Benbow&mdash;"tolls it every day?                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Where is the life I led?"&mdash;He sigh'd, and walk'd his way.      </p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XVII.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE HOSPITAL AND GOVERNORS.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">An ardent spirit dwells with Christian love,</p>
<p>The eagle's vigour in the pitying dove;</p>
<p>'Tis not enough that we with sorrow sigh,</p>
<p>That we the wants of pleading man supply;</p>
<p>That we in sympathy with sufferers feel,</p>
<p>Nor hear a grief without a wish to heal.</p>
<p>Not these suffice&mdash;to sickness, pain, and wo,</p>
<p>The Christian spirit loves with aid to go;</p>
<p>Will not be sought, waits not for want to plead,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>But seeks the duty&mdash;nay, prevents the need;                     </p>
<p>Her utmost aid to every ill applies,</p>
<p>And plans relief for coming miseries.</p>
<p class="i1">Hence yonder building rose: on either side</p>
<p>Far stretch'd the wards, all airy, warm, and wide;</p>
<p>And every ward has beds by comfort spread,</p>
<p>And smooth'd for him who suffers on the bed.</p>
<p>There have all kindness, most relief&mdash;for some</p>
<p>Is cure complete&mdash;it is the sufferer's home:</p>
<p>Fevers and chronic ills, corroding pains,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Each accidental mischief man sustains;                          </p>
<p>Fractures and wounds, and wither'd limbs and lame,</p>
<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441" class="pagenum">[Pg 441]</a>
<p>With all that, slow or sudden, vex our frame,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Have here attendance&mdash;here the sufferers lie              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>(Where love and science every aid apply),                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And heal'd with rapture live, or soothed by comfort die.       </p>
<p class="i1">See one relieved from anguish, and to-day</p>
<p>Allow'd to walk and look an hour away;</p>
<p>Two months confined by fever, frenzy, pain,</p>
<p>He comes abroad and is himself again:</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>'Twas in the spring, when carried to the place,                 </p>
<p>The snow fell down and melted in his face.</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis summer now; all objects gay and new;</p>
<p>Smiling alike the viewer and the view:</p>
<p>He stops as one unwilling to advance,</p>
<p>Without another and another glance;</p>
<p>With what a pure and simple joy he sees</p>
<p>Those sheep and cattle browzing at their ease;</p>
<p>Easy himself, there's nothing breathes or moves</p>
<p>But he would cherish&mdash;all that lives he loves:</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Observing every ward as round he goes,                          </p>
<p>He thinks what pain, what danger they enclose;</p>
<p>Warm in his wish for all who suffer there,</p>
<p>At every view he meditates a prayer:</p>
<p>No evil counsels in his breast abide,</p>
<p>There joy, and love, and gratitude reside.</p>
<p class="i1">The wish that Roman necks in one were found,</p>
<p>That he who form'd the wish might deal the wound,</p>
<p>This man had never heard; but of the kind,</p>
<p>Is that desire which rises in his mind;</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>He'd have all English hands (for further he                     </p>
<p>Cannot conceive extends our charity),</p>
<p>All but his own, in one right-hand to grow,</p>
<p>And then what hearty shake would he bestow!</p>
<p class="i1">"How rose the building?"&mdash;Piety first laid</p>
<p>A strong foundation, but she wanted aid;</p>
<p>To Wealth unwieldy was her prayer address'd,</p>
<p>Who largely gave, and she the donor bless'd.</p>
<p>Unwieldy Wealth then to his couch withdrew,</p>
<p>And took the sweetest sleep he ever knew.</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p class="i1">Then busy Vanity sustain'd her part,           </p>
<p>"And much," she said, "it moved her tender heart;</p>
<a name="Page_442" id="Page_442" class="pagenum">[Pg 442]</a>
<p>To her all kinds of man's distress were known,</p>
<p>And all her heart adopted as its own."</p>
<p class="i1">Then Science came&mdash;his talents he display'd,</p>
<p>And Charity with joy the dome survey'd;</p>
<p>Skill, Wealth, and Vanity, obtain the fame,</p>
<p>And Piety, the joy that makes no claim.</p>
<p class="i1">Patrons there are, and governors, from whom</p>
<p>The greater aid and guiding orders come;</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Who voluntary cares and labours take,                           </p>
<p>The sufferers' servants for the service' sake.</p>
<p>Of these a part I give you&mdash;but a <span class="locked">part&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Some hearts are hidden; some have not a heart.</p>
<p class="i1">First let me praise&mdash;for so I best shall <span class="locked">paint&mdash;</span></p>
<p>That pious moralist, that reasoning saint!</p>
<p>Can I of worth like thine, Eusebius, speak?</p>
<p>The man is willing, but the muse is <span class="locked">weak;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Tis thine to wait on wo! to soothe! to heal!</p>
<p>With learning social, and polite with zeal:</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>In thy pure breast although the passions dwell,                 </p>
<p>They're train'd by virtue and no more rebel;</p>
<p>But have so long been active on her side,</p>
<p>That passion now might be itself the guide.</p>
<p class="i1">Law, conscience, honour, all obey'd; all give</p>
<p>Th' approving voice, and make it bliss to live;</p>
<p>While faith, when life can nothing more supply,</p>
<p>Shall strengthen hope, and make it bliss to die.</p>
<p class="i1">He preaches, speaks and writes with manly <span class="locked">sense&mdash;</span></p>
<p>No weak neglect, no laboured eloquence;</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Goodness and wisdom are in all his ways,                        </p>
<p>The rude revere him and the wicked praise.</p>
<p class="i1">Upon humility his virtues grow,</p>
<p>And tower so high because so fix'd below;</p>
<p>As wider spreads the oak his boughs around,</p>
<p>When deeper with his roots he digs the solid ground.</p>
<p class="i1">By him, from ward to ward, is every aid</p>
<p>The sufferer needs with every care convey'd.</p>
<p>Like the good tree he brings his treasure forth,</p>
<p>And, like the tree, unconscious of his worth;</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Meek as the poorest Publican is he,                            </p>
<p>And strict as lives the straitest Pharisee;</p>
<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443" class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</a>
<p>Of both, in him unite the better <span class="locked">part&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The blameless conduct and the humble heart.</p>
<p class="i1">Yet he escapes not; he, with some, is wise</p>
<p>In carnal things, and loves to moralize;</p>
<p>Others can doubt, if all that Christian care</p>
<p>Has not its price&mdash;there's something he may share.</p>
<p>But this, and ill severer, he sustains,</p>
<p>As gold the fire, and as unhurt remains;</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>When most reviled, although he feels the smart,                </p>
<p>It wakes to nobler deeds the wounded heart,</p>
<p>As the rich olive, beaten for its fruit,</p>
<p>Puts forth at every bruise a bearing shoot.</p>
<p class="i1">A second friend we have, whose care and zeal</p>
<p>But few can equal&mdash;few indeed can feel.</p>
<p>He lived a life obscure, and profits made</p>
<p>In the coarse habits of a vulgar trade.</p>
<p>His brother, master of a hoy, he loved</p>
<p>So well, that he the calling disapproved:</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>"Alas! poor Tom!" the landman oft would sigh,                  </p>
<p>When the gale freshen'd and the waves ran high;</p>
<p>And when they parted, with a tear he'd say,</p>
<p>"No more adventure!&mdash;here in safety stay."</p>
<p>Nor did he feign; with more than half he had,</p>
<p>He would have kept the seaman, and been glad.</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! how few resist, when strongly tried!&mdash;</p>
<p>A rich relation's nearer kinsman died;</p>
<p>He sicken'd, and to him the landman went,</p>
<p>And all his hours with cousin Ephraim spent.</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>This Thomas heard, and cared not: "I," quoth he,               </p>
<p>"Have one in port upon the watch for me."</p>
<p>So Ephraim died, and, when the will was shown,</p>
<p>Isaac, the landman, had the whole his own:</p>
<p>Who to his brother sent a moderate purse,</p>
<p>Which he return'd, in anger, with his curse;</p>
<p>Then went to sea, and made his grog so strong,</p>
<p>He died before he could forgive the wrong.</p>
<p class="i1">The rich man built a house, both large and high,</p>
<p>He enter'd in and set him down to sigh;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>He planted ample woods and gardens fair,                       </p>
<p>And walk'd with anguish and compunction there:</p>
<a name="Page_444" id="Page_444" class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</a>
<p>The rich man's pines, to every friend a treat,</p>
<p>He saw with pain, and he refused to eat;</p>
<p>His daintiest food, his richest wines, were all</p>
<p>Turn'd by remorse to vinegar and gall:</p>
<p>The softest down, by living body press'd,</p>
<p>The rich man bought, and tried to take his rest;</p>
<p>But care had thorns upon his pillow spread,</p>
<p>And scatter'd sand and nettles in his bed.</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Nervous he grew&mdash;would often sigh and groan,                   </p>
<p>He talk'd but little, and he walk'd alone;</p>
<p>Till by his priest convinced, that from one deed</p>
<p>Of genuine love would joy and health proceed;</p>
<p>He from that time with care and zeal began</p>
<p>To seek and soothe the grievous ills of man;</p>
<p>And, as his hands their aid to grief apply,</p>
<p>He learns to smile and he forgets to sigh.</p>
<p class="i1">Now he can drink his wine and taste his food.</p>
<p>And feel the blessings Heav'n has dealt are good;</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>And, since the suffering seek the rich man's door,             </p>
<p>He sleeps as soundly as when young and poor.</p>
<p class="i1">Here much he gives&mdash;is urgent more to gain;</p>
<p>He begs&mdash;rich beggars seldom sue in vain;</p>
<p>Preachers most famed he moves, the crowd to move,</p>
<p>And never wearies in the work of love;</p>
<p>He rules all business, settles all affairs,</p>
<p>He makes collections, he directs repairs;</p>
<p>And if he wrong'd one brother&mdash;Heav'n forgive</p>
<p>The man by whom so many brethren live!</p>
</div>
<hr  class="hr45" />
<div class="stanza">
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p class="i1">Then, 'mid our signatures, a name appears        </p>
<p>Of one for wisdom famed above his years;</p>
<p>And these were forty: he was from his youth</p>
<p>A patient searcher after useful truth:</p>
<p>To language little of his time he gave,</p>
<p>To science less, nor was the muse's slave;</p>
<p>Sober and grave, his college sent him down,</p>
<p>A fair example for his native town.</p>
<p class="i1">Slowly he speaks, and with such solemn air,</p>
<p>You'd think a Socrates or Solon there,</p>
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445" class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</a>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>For though a Christian, he's disposed to draw                  </p>
<p>His rules from reason's and from nature's law.</p>
<p>"Know," he exclaims, "my fellow mortals, know,</p>
<p>Virtue alone is happiness below;</p>
<p>And what is virtue? Prudence, first to choose</p>
<p>Life's real good&mdash;the evil to refuse;</p>
<p>Add justice then, the eager hand to hold,</p>
<p>To curb the lust of power and thirst of gold;</p>
<p>Join temp'rance next, that cheerful health insures,</p>
<p>And fortitude unmoved, that conquers or endures."</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p class="i1">He speaks, and lo!&mdash;the very man you see:        </p>
<p>Prudent and temperate, just and patient he;</p>
<p>By prudence taught his worldly wealth to keep,</p>
<p>No folly wastes, no avarice swells the heap:</p>
<p>He no man's debtor, no man's patron lives;</p>
<p>Save sound advice, he neither asks nor gives;</p>
<p>By no vain thoughts or erring fancy sway'd,</p>
<p>His words are weighty, or at least are weigh'd;</p>
<p>Temp'rate in every place&mdash;abroad, at home,</p>
<p>Thence will applause, and hence will profit come;</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And health from either he in time prepares                     </p>
<p>For sickness, age, and their attendant cares,</p>
<p>But not for fancy's ills;&mdash;he never grieves</p>
<p>For love that wounds or friendship that deceives;</p>
<p>His patient soul endures what Heav'n ordains,</p>
<p>But neither feels nor fears ideal pains.</p>
<p class="i1">"Is aught then wanted in a man so wise?<span class="locked">"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Alas!&mdash;I think he wants infirmities;</p>
<p>He wants the ties that knit us to our <span class="locked">kind&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The cheerful, tender, soft, complacent mind,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>That would the feelings, which he dreads, excite,              </p>
<p>And make the virtues he approves delight;</p>
<p>What dying martyrs, saints, and patriots <span class="locked">feel&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The strength of action and the warmth of zeal.</p>
<p class="i1">Again attend!&mdash;and see a man whose cares</p>
<p>Are nicely placed on either world's <span class="locked">affairs.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Merchant and saint, 'tis doubtful if he knows</p>
<p>To which account he most regard bestows;</p>
<p>Of both he keeps his ledger:&mdash;there he reads</p>
<p>Of gainful ventures and of godly deeds;</p>
<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446" class="pagenum">[Pg 446]</a>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>There all he gets or loses find a place&mdash;                      </p>
<p>A lucky bargain and a lack of grace.</p>
<p class="i1">The joys above this prudent man invite</p>
<p>To pay his tax&mdash;devotion!&mdash;day and night;</p>
<p>The pains of hell his timid bosom awe,</p>
<p>And force obedience to the church's law:</p>
<p>Hence that continual thought, that solemn air,</p>
<p>Those sad good works, and that laborious prayer.</p>
<p class="i1">All these (when conscience, waken'd and afraid</p>
<p>To think how avarice calls and is obey'd)</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>He in his journal finds, and for his grief                     </p>
<p>Obtains the transient opium of relief.</p>
<p class="i1">"Sink not, my soul!&mdash;my spirit, rise and look</p>
<p>O'er the fair entries of this precious book:</p>
<p>Here are the sins, our debts;&mdash;this fairer side</p>
<p>Has what to carnal wish our strength denied;</p>
<p>Has those religious duties every day</p>
<p>Paid&mdash;which so few upon the sabbath pay;</p>
<p>Here too are conquests over frail desires,</p>
<p>Attendance due on all the church requires;</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Then alms I give&mdash;for I believe the word                       </p>
<p>Of holy writ, and lend unto the <span class="locked">Lord&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And, if not all th' importunate demand,</p>
<p>The fear of want restrains my ready hand;</p>
<p>&mdash;Behold what sums I to the poor resign,</p>
<p>Sums placed in Heaven's own book, as well as mine!</p>
<p>Rest, then, my spirit!&mdash;fastings, prayers, and alms,</p>
<p>Will soon suppress these idly-raised alarms,</p>
<p>And, weigh'd against our frailties, set in view</p>
<p>A noble balance in our favour due.</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Add that I yearly here affix my name,                          </p>
<p>Pledge for large payment&mdash;not from love of fame,</p>
<p>But to make peace within;&mdash;that peace to make,</p>
<p>What sums I lavish! and what gains forsake!</p>
<p>Cheer up, my heart!&mdash;let's cast off every doubt,</p>
<p>Pray without dread, and place our money out."</p>
<p class="i1">Such the religion of a mind that steers</p>
<p>Its way to bliss, between its hopes and fears;</p>
<p>Whose passions in due bounds each other keep,</p>
<p>And, thus subdued, they murmur till they sleep;</p>
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447" class="pagenum">[Pg 447]</a>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Whose virtues all their certain limits know,                   </p>
<p>Like well-dried herbs that neither fade nor grow;</p>
<p>Who for success and safety ever tries,</p>
<p>And with both worlds alternately complies.</p>
<p class="i1">Such are the guardians of this bless'd estate;</p>
<p>Whate'er without, they're praised within the gate;</p>
<p>That they are men, and have their faults, is true,</p>
<p>But here their worth alone appears in view:</p>
<p>The Muse indeed, who reads the very breast,</p>
<p>Has something of the secrets there express'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>But yet in charity;&mdash;and, when she sees                        </p>
<p>Such means for joy or comfort, health or ease,</p>
<p>And knows how much united minds effect,</p>
<p>She almost dreads their failings to detect;</p>
<p>But truth commands:&mdash;in man's erroneous kind,</p>
<p>Virtues and frailties mingle in the mind;</p>
<p>Happy, when fears to public spirit move,</p>
<p>And even vices to the work of love!</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XVIII.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">THE POOR AND THEIR DWELLINGS.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">Yes! we've our Borough-vices, and I know</p>
<p>How far they spread, how rapidly they grow;</p>
<p>Yet think not virtue quits the busy place,</p>
<p>Nor charity, the virtues' crown and grace.</p>
<p class="i1">"Our poor how feed we?"&mdash;To the most we give</p>
<p>A weekly dole, and at their homes they <span class="locked">live;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Others together dwell&mdash;but when they come</p>
<p>To the low roof, they see a kind of home,</p>
<p>A social people whom they've ever known,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>With their own thoughts and manners like their own.             </p>
<p class="i1">At her old house, her dress, her air the same,</p>
<p>I see mine ancient letter-loving dame:</p>
<p>"Learning, my child," said she, "shall fame command;</p>
<p>Learning is better worth than house or <span class="locked">land&mdash;</span></p>
<p>For houses perish, lands are gone and spent;</p>
<p>In learning then excel, for that's most excellent."</p>
<p class="i1">"And what her learning?"&mdash;'Tis with awe to look</p>
<p>In every verse throughout one sacred book;</p>
<p>From this her joy, her hope, her peace is sought:</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>This she has learn'd, and she is nobly taught.                  </p>
<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450" class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</a>
<p class="i1">If aught of mine have gain'd the public ear;</p>
<p>If <span class="smcap">Rutland</span> deigns these humble Tales to hear;</p>
<p>If critics pardon what my friends approved,</p>
<p>Can I mine ancient widow pass unmoved?</p>
<p>Shall I not think what pains the matron took,</p>
<p>When first I trembled o'er the gilded book?</p>
<p>How she, all patient, both at eve and morn,</p>
<p>Her needle pointed at the guarding horn;</p>
<p>And how she soothed me, when, with study sad,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>I labour'd on to reach the final zad?                           </p>
<p>Shall I not grateful still the dame survey,</p>
<p>And ask the muse the poet's debt to pay?</p>
<p class="i1">Nor I alone, who hold a trifler's pen,</p>
<p>But half our bench of wealthy, weighty men,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Who rule our Borough, who enforce our laws,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>They own the matron as the leading cause,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And feel the pleasing debt, and pay the just applause:         </p>
<p>To her own house is borne the week's supply;</p>
<p>There she in credit lives, there hopes in peace to die.</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p class="i1">With her a harmless idiot we behold,           </p>
<p>Who hoards up silver shells for shining gold;</p>
<p>These he preserves, with unremitted care,</p>
<p>To buy a seat, and reign the Borough's mayor:</p>
<p>Alas!&mdash;who could th' ambitious changeling tell,</p>
<p>That what he sought our rulers dared to sell?</p>
<p class="i1">Near these a sailor in that hut of thatch</p>
<p>(A fish-boat's cabin is its nearest match)</p>
<p>Dwells, and the dungeon is to him a seat,</p>
<p>Large as he wishes&mdash;in his view complete.</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>A lockless coffer and a lidless hutch                           </p>
<p>That hold his stores, have room for twice as much;</p>
<p>His one spare shirt, long glass, and iron box,</p>
<p>Lie all in view; no need has he for locks.</p>
<p>Here he abides, and, as our strangers pass,</p>
<p>He shows the shipping, he presents the glass;</p>
<p>He makes (unask'd) their ports and business known,</p>
<p>And (kindly heard) turns quickly to his own.</p>
<p>Of noble captains&mdash;heroes every <span class="locked">one&mdash;</span></p>
<p>You might as soon have made the steeple run:</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>And then his messmates, if you're pleased to stay,              </p>
<a name="Page_451" id="Page_451" class="pagenum">[Pg 451]</a>
<p>He'll one by one the gallant souls display;</p>
<p>And as the story verges to an end,</p>
<p>He'll wind from deed to deed, from friend to friend;</p>
<p>He'll speak of those long lost, the brave of old,</p>
<p>As princes gen'rous and as heroes bold;</p>
<p>Then will his feelings rise, till you may trace</p>
<p>Gloom, like a cloud, frown o'er his manly <span class="locked">face&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And then a tear or two, which sting his pride,</p>
<p>These he will dash indignantly aside,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>And splice his tale;&mdash;now take him from his cot,                </p>
<p>And for some cleaner [berth] exchange his lot,</p>
<p>How will he all that cruel aid deplore?</p>
<p>His heart will break, and he will fight no more.</p>
<p class="i1">Here is the poor old merchant: he declined,</p>
<p>And, as they say, is not in perfect mind;</p>
<p>In his poor house, with one poor maiden friend,</p>
<p>Quiet he paces to his journey's end.</p>
<p class="i1">Rich in his youth, he traded and he fail'd;</p>
<p>Again he tried, again his fate prevail'd;</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>His spirits low and his exertions small,                        </p>
<p>He fell perforce, he seem'd decreed to fall:</p>
<p>Like the gay knight, unapt to rise was he,</p>
<p>But downward sank with sad alacrity.</p>
<p>A borough-place we gain'd him&mdash;in disgrace</p>
<p>For gross neglect, he quickly lost the place;</p>
<p>But still he kept a kind of sullen pride,</p>
<p>Striving his wants to hinder or to hide.</p>
<p>At length, compell'd by very need, in grief</p>
<p>He wrote a proud petition for relief.</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p class="i1">"He did suppose a fall, like his, would prove       </p>
<p>Of force to wake their sympathy and love;</p>
<p>Would make them feel the changes all may know,</p>
<p>And stir them up a new regard to show."</p>
<p class="i1">His suit was granted;&mdash;to an ancient maid,</p>
<p>Relieved herself, relief for him was paid.</p>
<p>Here they together (meet companions) dwell,</p>
<p>And dismal tales of man's misfortunes tell:</p>
<p>"'Twas not a world for them, God help them! they</p>
<p>Could not deceive, nor flatter, nor betray;</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>But there's a happy change, a scene to come,                   </p>
<a name="Page_452" id="Page_452" class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</a>
<p>And they, God help them! shall be soon at home."</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">If these no pleasures nor enjoyments gain,    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Still none their spirits nor their speech restrain;          </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>They sigh at ease, 'mid comforts they complain.                </p>
<p>The poor will grieve, the poor will weep and sigh,</p>
<p>Both when they know, and when they know not why;</p>
<p>But we our bounty with such care bestow,</p>
<p>That cause for grieving they shall seldom know.</p>
<p class="i1">Your plan I love not;&mdash;with a number you</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Have placed your poor, your pitiable few;                      </p>
<p>There, in one house, throughout their lives to <span class="locked">be&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The pauper-palace which they hate to see;</p>
<p>That giant-building, that high-bounding wall,</p>
<p>Those bare-worn walks, that lofty thund'ring hall!</p>
<p>That large loud clock, which tolls each dreaded hour;</p>
<p>Those gates and locks, and all those signs of power:</p>
<p>It is a prison, with a milder name,</p>
<p>Which few inhabit without dread or shame.</p>
<p class="i1">Be it agreed&mdash;the poor who hither come</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>

<p>To leave each scene familiar, every face,</p>
<p>For a new people and a stranger race;</p>
<p>For those who, sunk in sloth and dead to shame,</p>
<p>From scenes of guilt with daring spirits came;</p>
<p>Men, just and guileless, at such manners start,</p>
<p>And bless their God that time has fenced their heart,</p>
<p>Confirm'd their virtue, and expell'd the fear</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Of vice in minds so simple and sincere.                        </p>
<p class="i1">Here the good pauper, losing all the praise</p>
<p>By worthy deeds acquired in better days,</p>
<p>Breathes a few months; then, to his chamber led,</p>
<p>Expires, while strangers prattle round his bed.</p>
<p class="i1">The grateful hunter, when his horse is old,</p>
<p>Wills not the useless favourite to be sold;</p>

<p>With building yards immix'd, and humble sheds and shops;       </p>
<p>Where the Cross-Keys and Plumber's-Arms invite</p>
<p>Laborious men to taste their coarse delight;</p>
<p>Where the low porches, stretching from the door,</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Gave some distinction in the days of yore&mdash;                    </p>
<p>Yet now, neglected, more offend the eye</p>
<p>By gloom and ruin than the cottage by.</p>
<p>Places like these the noblest town endures,</p>
<p>The gayest palace has its sinks and sewers.</p>
<p class="i1">Here is no pavement, no inviting shop,</p>
<p>To give us shelter when compell'd to stop;</p>
<p>But plashy puddles stand along the way,</p>
<p>Fill'd by the rain of one tempestuous day;</p>
<a name="Page_456" id="Page_456" class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</a>
<p>And these so closely to the buildings run,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>That you must ford them, for you cannot shun;                  </p>
<p>Though here and there convenient bricks are laid,</p>
<p>And door-side heaps afford their dubious aid.</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! yonder shed; observe its garden-ground,</p>
<p>With the low paling, form'd of wreck, around:</p>
<p>There dwells a fisher; if you view his boat,</p>
<p>With bed and barrel&mdash;'tis his house afloat;</p>
<p>Look at his house, where ropes, nets, blocks, abound,</p>
<p>Tar, pitch, and oakum&mdash;'tis his boat aground:</p>
<p>That space enclosed but little he regards,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>

<p class="i1">Here our reformers come not; none object</p>

<p>None care that ashy heaps at doors are cast,</p>
<p>That coal-dust flies along the blinding blast;</p>
<p>None heed the stagnant pools on either side,</p>

<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>Rodneys in rags here British valour boast,                     </p>
<p>And lisping Nelsons fright the Gallic coast.</p>
<p>They fix the rudder, set the swelling sail,</p>
<p>They point the bowsprit, and they blow the gale.</p>
<p>True to her port, the frigate scuds away,</p>
<p>And o'er that frowning ocean finds her bay:</p>
<p>Her owner rigg'd her, and he knows her worth,</p>

<p>On hills of dust the henbane's faded green,</p>

<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>But fearless yonder matron; she disdains                       </p>

<p>Woos the coy breeze, to fan the open breast.</p>
<p>She, once a handmaid, strove by decent art</p>

<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>Her bosom then was veil'd in kerchief clean,                   </p>
<p>And fancy left to form the charms unseen.</p>
<p class="i1">But, when a wife, she lost her former care,</p>
<p>Nor thought on charms, nor time for dress could spare;</p>
<p>Careless she found her friends who dwelt beside;</p>
<p>No rival beauty kept alive her pride:</p>
<p>Still in her bosom virtue keeps her place;</p>

<p>His clerk, hight Jachin, to his office came:                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The like slow speech was his, the like tall slender frame.     </p>
<p>But Jachin was the gravest man on ground,</p>
<p>And heard his master's jokes with look profound;</p>
<p>For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh'd,</p>
<p>And had a sprinkling of the spirit's pride;</p>
<p>But he was sober, chaste, devout, and just,</p>
<p>One whom his neighbours could believe and trust:</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Of none suspected, neither man nor maid                         </p>
<p>By him were wrong'd, or were of him afraid.</p>
<p class="i1">There was indeed a frown, a trick of state</p>
<p>In Jachin;&mdash;formal was his air and gait;</p>
<p>But if he seem'd more solemn and less kind</p>
<p>Than some light men to light affairs confined,</p>
<p>Still 'twas allow'd that he should so behave</p>
<p>As in high seat, and be severely grave.</p>
<p class="i1">This book-taught man to man's first foe profess'd</p>
<p>Defiance stern, and hate that knew not rest;</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>He held that Satan, since the world began,                      </p>
<p>In every act had strife with every man;</p>
<a name="Page_462" id="Page_462" class="pagenum">[Pg 462]</a>
<p>That never evil deed on earth was done,</p>
<p>But of the acting parties he was one:</p>
<p>The flattering guide to make ill prospers clear;</p>
<p>To smooth rough ways the constant pioneer;</p>
<p>The ever-tempting, soothing, softening power,</p>
<p>Ready to cheat, seduce, deceive, devour.</p>
<p class="i1">"Me has the sly seducer oft withstood,"</p>
<p>Said pious Jachin,&mdash;"but he gets no good;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>I pass the house where swings the tempting sign,                </p>
<p>And, pointing, tell him, 'Satan, that is thine;'</p>
<p>I pass the damsels pacing down the street,</p>
<p>And look more grave and solemn when we meet;</p>
<p>Nor doth it irk me to rebuke their smiles,</p>
<p>Their wanton ambling and their watchful wiles.</p>
<p>Nay, like the good John Bunyan, when I view</p>
<p>Those forms, I'm angry at the ills they do;</p>
<p>That I could pinch and spoil, in sin's despite,</p>
<p>Beauties, which frail and evil thoughts excite<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>!</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p class="i1">"At feasts and banquets seldom am I found,        </p>
<p>And (save at church) abhor a tuneful sound;</p>
<p>To plays and shows I run not to and fro,</p>
<p>And where my master goes forbear to go."</p>
<p class="i1">No wonder Satan took the thing amiss,</p>
<p>To be opposed by such a man as <span class="locked">this&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A man so grave, important, cautious, wise,</p>
<p>Who dared not trust his feeling or his eyes;</p>
<p>No wonder he should lurk and lie in wait,</p>
<p>Should fit his hooks and ponder on his bait;</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Should on his movements keep a watchful eye;                    </p>
<p>For he pursued a fish who led the fry.</p>
<p class="i1">With his own peace our clerk was not content;</p>
<p>He tried, good man! to make his friends repent.</p>
<p class="i1">"Nay, nay, my friends, from inns and taverns fly;</p>
<p>You may suppress your thirst, but not supply.</p>
<p>A foolish proverb says, 'the devil's at home;'</p>
<p>But he is there, and tempts in every room:</p>
<p>Men feel, they know not why, such places please;</p>
<a name="Page_463" id="Page_463" class="pagenum">[Pg 463]</a>
<p>His are the spells&mdash;they're idleness and ease;</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Magic of fatal kind he throws around,                           </p>
<p>Where care is banish'd but the heart is bound.</p>
<p class="i1">"Think not of beauty; when a maid you meet,</p>
<p>Turn from her view, and step across the street;</p>
<p>Dread all the sex: their looks create a charm,</p>
<p>A smile should fright you and a word alarm.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>E'en I myself, with all my watchful care,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Have for an instant felt th' insidious snare,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And caught my sinful eyes at th' endangering stare;            </p>
<p>Till I was forced to smite my bounding breast</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>With forceful blow and bid the bold-one rest.                   </p>
<p class="i1">"Go not with crowds when they to pleasure run,</p>
<p>But public joy in private safety shun.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>When bells, diverted from their true intent,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Ring loud for some deluded mortal sent                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>To hear or make long speech in parliament;                     </p>
<p>What time the many, that unruly beast,</p>
<p>Roars its rough joy and shares the final feast:</p>
<p>Then heed my counsel, shut thine ears and eyes;</p>
<p>A few will hear me&mdash;for the few are wise."</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p class="i1">Not Satan's friends, nor Satan's self could bear     </p>
<p>The cautious man who took of souls such care:</p>
<p>An interloper&mdash;one who, out of place,</p>
<p>Had volunteer'd upon the side of grace.</p>
<p>There was his master ready once a week</p>
<p>To give advice; what further need he seek?</p>
<p>"Amen, so be it:"&mdash;what had he to do</p>
<p>With more than this?&mdash;'twas insolent and new;</p>
<p>And some determined on a way to see</p>
<p>How frail he was, that so it might not be.</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p class="i1">First they essay'd to tempt our saint to sin,       </p>
<p>By points of doctrine argued at an inn;</p>
<p>Where he might warmly reason, deeply drink,</p>
<p>Then lose all power to argue and to think.</p>
<p class="i1">In vain they tried; he took the question up,</p>
<p>Clear'd every doubt, and barely touch'd the cup;</p>
<p>By many a text he proved his doctrine sound,</p>
<p>And look'd in triumph on the tempters round.</p>
<p class="i1">Next 'twas their care an artful lass to find,</p>
<a name="Page_464" id="Page_464" class="pagenum">[Pg 464]</a>
<p>Who might consult him, as perplex'd in mind;</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>She, they conceived, might put her case with fears,            </p>
<p>With tender tremblings and seducing tears;</p>
<p>She might such charms of various kind display,</p>
<p>That he would feel their force and melt away:</p>
<p>For why of nymphs such caution and such dread,</p>
<p>Unless he felt and fear'd to be misled?</p>
<p class="i1">She came, she spake: he calmly heard her case,</p>
<p>And plainly told her 'twas a want of grace;</p>
<p>Bade her "such fancies and affections check,</p>
<p>And wear a thicker muslin on her neck."</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Abased, his human foes the combat fled,                        </p>
<p>And the stern clerk yet higher held his head.</p>
<p>They were indeed a weak, impatient set;</p>
<p>But their shrewd prompter had his engines yet;</p>
<p>Had various means to make a mortal trip,</p>
<p>Who shunn'd a flowing bowl and rosy lip;</p>
<p>And knew a thousand ways his heart to move,</p>
<p>Who flies from banquets and who laughs at love.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus far the playful Muse has lent her aid,</p>
<p>But now departs, of graver theme afraid;</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Her may we seek in more appropriate time&mdash;                     </p>
<p>There is no jesting with distress and crime.</p>
<p class="i1">Our worthy clerk had now arrived at fame,</p>
<p>Such as but few in his degree might claim;</p>
<p>But he was poor, and wanted not the sense</p>
<p>That lowly rates the praise without the pence:</p>
<p>He saw the common herd with reverence treat</p>
<p>The weakest burgess whom they chanced to meet;</p>
<p>While few respected his exalted views,</p>
<p>And all beheld his doublet and his shoes;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>None, when they meet, would to his parts allow                 </p>
<p>(Save his poor boys) a hearing or a bow.</p>
<p>To this false judgment of the vulgar mind</p>
<p>He was not fully, as a saint, resign'd;</p>
<p>He found it much his jealous soul affect,</p>
<p>To fear derision and to find neglect.</p>
<p class="i1">The year was bad, the christening-fees were small,</p>
<p>The weddings few, the parties paupers all:</p>
<p>Desire of gain, with fear of want combined,</p>
<a name="Page_465" id="Page_465" class="pagenum">[Pg 465]</a>
<p>Raised sad commotion in his wounded mind;</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Wealth was in all his thoughts, his views, his dreams,         </p>
<p>And prompted base desires and baseless schemes.</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! how often erring mortals keep</p>
<p>The strongest watch against the foes who sleep;</p>
<p>While the more wakeful, bold and artful foe</p>
<p>Is suffer'd guardless and unmark'd to go.</p>
<p class="i1">Once in a month the sacramental bread</p>
<p>Our clerk with wine upon the table spread;</p>
<p>The custom this, that, as the vicar reads,</p>
<p>He for our off'rings round the church proceeds.</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Tall, spacious seats the wealthier people hid,                 </p>
<p>And none had view of what his neighbour did;</p>
<p>Laid on the box and mingled when they fell,</p>
<p>Who should the worth of each oblation tell?</p>
<p>Now as poor Jachin took the usual round,</p>
<p>And saw the alms and heard the metal sound,</p>
<p>He had a thought;&mdash;at first it was no more</p>
<p>Than&mdash;"these have cash and give it to the poor."</p>
<p>A second thought from this to work <span class="locked">began&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"And can they give it to a poorer man?"</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Proceeding thus&mdash;"My merit could they know,                    </p>
<p>And knew my need, how freely they'd bestow;</p>
<p>But though they know not, these remain the same;</p>
<p>And are a strong, although a secret claim:</p>
<p>To me, alas! the want and worth are <span class="locked">known;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Why then, in fact, 'tis but to take my own."</p>
<p class="i1">Thought after thought pour'd in, a tempting <span class="locked">train&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Suppose it done, who is it could complain?</p>
<p>How could the poor? for they such trifles share</p>
<p>As add no comfort, as suppress no care;</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>But many a pittance makes a worthy heap&mdash;                      </p>
<p>What says the law? that silence puts to <span class="locked">sleep;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Nought then forbids, the danger could we shun;</p>
<p>And sure the business may be safely done.</p>
<p class="i1">"But am I earnest?&mdash;earnest? No.&mdash;I say,</p>
<p>If such my mind, that I could plan a way;</p>
<p>Let me reflect;&mdash;I've not allow'd me time</p>
<p>To purse the pieces, and if dropp'd they'd chime."</p>
<p>Fertile is evil in the soul of <span class="locked">man&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_466" id="Page_466" class="pagenum">[Pg 466]</a>
<p>He paused&mdash;said Jachin, "They may drop on bran.</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>Why then 'tis safe and (all consider'd) just;                  </p>
<p>The poor receive it&mdash;'tis no breach of trust;</p>
<p>The old and widows may their trifles miss,</p>
<p>There must be evil in a good like this.</p>
<p>But I'll be kind&mdash;the sick I'll visit twice,</p>
<p>When now but once, and freely give advice.</p>
<p>Yet let me think again,"&mdash;Again he tried</p>
<p>For stronger reasons on his passion's side;</p>
<p>And quickly these were found, yet slowly he complied.</p>
<p class="i1">The morning came: the common service <span class="locked">done&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Shut every door&mdash;the solemn rite begun;                        </p>
<p>And, as the priest the sacred sayings read,</p>
<p>The clerk went forward, trembling as he tread;</p>
<p>O'er the tall pew he held the box, and heard</p>
<p>The offer'd piece, rejoicing as he fear'd.</p>
<p>Just by the pillar, as he cautious tripp'd,</p>
<p>And turn'd the aile, he then a portion slipp'd</p>
<p>From the full store, and to the pocket sent,</p>
<p>But held a moment&mdash;and then down it went.</p>
<p class="i1">The priest read on; on walk'd the man afraid,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Till a gold offering in the plate was laid;                    </p>
<p>Trembling he took it, for a moment stopp'd,</p>
<p>Then down it fell, and sounded as it dropp'd;</p>
<p>Amazed he started, for th' affrighted man,</p>
<p>Lost and bewildered, thought not of the bran;</p>
<p>But all were silent, all on things intent</p>
<p>Of high concern; none ear to money lent;</p>
<p>So on he walk'd, more cautious than before,</p>
<p>And gain'd the purposed sum, and one piece more.</p>
<p class="i1"><i>Practice makes perfect</i>;&mdash;when the month came round,</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>He dropp'd the cash, nor listen'd for a sound;                 </p>
<p>But yet, when, last of all th' assembled flock,</p>
<p>He ate and drank&mdash;it gave th' electric shock.</p>
<p>Oft was he forced his reasons to repeat,</p>
<p>Ere he could kneel in quiet at his seat;</p>
<p>But custom soothed him.&mdash;Ere a single year</p>
<p>All this was done without restraint or fear:</p>
<p>Cool and collected, easy and composed,</p>
<p>He was correct till all the service closed;</p>
<a name="Page_467" id="Page_467" class="pagenum">[Pg 467]</a>
<p>Then to his home, without a groan or sigh,</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Gravely he went, and laid his treasure by.                     </p>
<p class="i1">Want will complain: some widows had express'd</p>
<p>A doubt if they were favour'd like the rest;</p>
<p>The rest described with like regret their dole,</p>
<p>And thus from parts they reason'd to the whole;</p>
<p>When all agreed some evil must be done,</p>
<p>Or rich men's hearts grew harder than a stone.</p>
<p class="i1">Our easy vicar cut the matter short;</p>
<p>He would not listen to such vile report.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">All were not thus&mdash;there govern'd in that year  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>A stern stout churl, an angry overseer;                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>A tyrant fond of power, loud, lewd, and most severe.           </p>
<p>Him the mild vicar, him the graver clerk,</p>
<p>Advised, reproved, but nothing would he mark,</p>
<p>Save the disgrace; "and that, my friends," said he,</p>
<p>"Will I avenge, whenever time may be."</p>
<p>And now, alas! 'twas time;&mdash;from man to man</p>
<p>Doubt and alarm and shrewd suspicions ran.</p>
<p class="i1">With angry spirit and with sly intent,</p>
<p>This parish ruler to the altar went;</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>A private mark he fix'd on shillings three,                    </p>
<p>And but one mark could in the money see;</p>
<p>Besides, in peering round, he chanced to note</p>
<p>A sprinkling slight on Jachin's Sunday-coat.</p>
<p>All doubt was over:&mdash;when the flock were bless'd,</p>
<p>In wrath he rose, and thus his mind express'd,</p>
<p class="i1">"Foul deeds are here!" and, saying this, he took</p>
<p>The clerk, whose conscience, in her cold-fit, shook.</p>
<p>His pocket then was emptied on the place;</p>
<p>All saw his guilt; all witness'd his disgrace:</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>He fell, he fainted; not a groan, a look,                      </p>
<p>Escaped the culprit; 'twas a final <span class="locked">stroke&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A death-wound never to be heal'd&mdash;a fall</p>
<p>That all had witness'd, and amazed were all.</p>
<p class="i1">As he recover'd, to his mind it came,</p>
<p>"I owe to Satan this disgrace and shame."</p>
<p>All the seduction now appear'd in view;</p>
<p>"Let me withdraw," he said, and he withdrew;</p>
<p>No one withheld him, all in union cried,</p>
<a name="Page_468" id="Page_468" class="pagenum">[Pg 468]</a>
<p>E'en the avenger&mdash;"We are satisfied;"</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>For what has death in any form to give,                        </p>
<p>Equal to that man's terrors, if he live?</p>
<p class="i1">He lived in freedom, but he hourly saw</p>
<p>How much more fatal justice is than law;</p>
<p>He saw another in his office reign,</p>
<p>And his mild master treat him with disdain;</p>
<p>He saw that all men shunn'd him, some reviled;</p>
<p>The harsh pass'd frowning, and the simple smiled;</p>
<p>The town maintain'd him, but with some reproof;</p>
<p>"And clerks and scholars proudly kept aloof."</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p class="i1">In each lone place, dejected and dismay'd,        </p>
<p>Shrinking from view, his wasting form he laid;</p>
<p>Or to the restless sea and roaring wind</p>
<p>Gave the strong yearnings of a ruin'd mind.</p>
<p>On the broad beach, the silent summer day,</p>
<p>Stretch'd on some wreck, he wore his life away;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Or where the river mingles with the sea,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or on the mud-bank by the elder-tree,                        </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or by the bounding marsh-dyke, there was he;                   </p>
<p>And when unable to forsake the town,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>In the blind courts he sate desponding down&mdash;                  </p>
<p>Always alone; then feebly would he crawl</p>
<p>The church-way walk, and lean upon the wall.</p>
<p>Too ill for this, he lay beside the door,</p>
<p>Compell'd to hear the reasoning of the poor:</p>
<p>He look'd so pale, so weak, the pitying crowd</p>
<p>Their firm belief of his repentance vow'd;</p>
<p>They saw him then so ghastly and so thin,</p>
<p>That they exclaim'd, "Is this the work of sin?"</p>
<p class="i1">"Yes," in his better moments, he replied,</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>"Of sinful avarice and the spirit's pride;&mdash;                   </p>
<p>While yet untempted, I was safe and well;</p>
<p>Temptation came; I reason'd, and I fell.</p>
<p>To be man's guide and glory I design'd,</p>
<p>A rare example for our sinful kind;</p>
<p>But now my weakness and my guilt I see,</p>
<p>And am a warning&mdash;man, be warn'd by me!"</p>
<p class="i1">He said, and saw no more the human face;</p>
<p>To a lone loft he went, his dying place,</p>
<p>And, as the vicar of his state inquired,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>Turn'd to the wall and silently expired!                       </p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XX.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">ELLEN ORFORD.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">Observe yon tenement, apart and small,</p>
<p>Where the wet pebbles shine upon the wall;</p>
<p>Where the low benches lean beside the door,</p>
<p>And the red paling bounds the space before;</p>
<p>Where thrift and lavender and lad's-love<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> <span class="locked">bloom&mdash;</span></p>
<p>That humble dwelling is the widow's home.</p>
<p>There live a pair, for various fortunes known,</p>
<p>But the Blind Ellen will relate her <span class="locked">own;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yet, ere we hear the story she can tell,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>On prouder sorrows let us briefly dwell.                        </p>
<p class="i1">I've often marvel'd, when by night, by day,</p>
<p>I've mark'd the manners moving in my way,</p>
<p>And heard the language and beheld the lives</p>
<p>Of lass and lover, goddesses and wives:</p>
<p>That books, which promise much of life to give,</p>
<p>Should show so little how we truly live.</p>
<p class="i1">To me it seems, their females and their men</p>
<p>Are but the creatures of the author's pen;</p>
<p>Nay, creatures borrow'd and again convey'd</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>From book to book&mdash;the shadows of a shade.                      </p>
<p>Life, if they'd search, would show them many a change,</p>
<p>The ruin sudden and the misery strange!</p>
<a name="Page_471" id="Page_471" class="pagenum">[Pg 471]</a>
<p>With more of grievous, base, and dreadful things,</p>
<p>Than novelists relate or poet sings.</p>
<p>But they, who ought to look the world around,</p>
<p>Spy out a single spot in fairy-ground;</p>
<p>Where all, in turn, ideal forms behold,</p>
<p>And plots are laid and histories are told.</p>
<p class="i1">Time have I lent&mdash;I would their debt were <span class="locked">less&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>To flow'ry pages of sublime distress;                           </p>
<p>And to the heroine's soul-distracting fears</p>
<p>I early gave my sixpences and tears:</p>
<p>Oft have I travell'd in these tender tales,</p>
<p>To Darnley-Cottages and Maple-Vales,</p>
<p>And watch'd the fair-one from the first-born sigh,</p>
<p>When Henry pass'd and gazed in passing by;</p>
<p>Till I beheld them pacing in the park,</p>
<p>Close by a coppice where 'twas cold and dark;</p>
<p>When such affection with such fate appear'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Want and a father to be shunn'd and fear'd,                     </p>
<p>Without employment, prospect, cot, or cash,</p>
<p>That I have judged th' heroic souls were rash.</p>
<p class="i1">Now shifts the scene&mdash;the fair, in tower confined,</p>
<p>In all things suffers but in change of mind;</p>
<p>Now woo'd by greatness to a bed of state,</p>
<p>Now deeply threaten'd with a dungeon's grate;</p>
<p>Till, suffering much and being tried enough,</p>
<p>She shines, triumphant maid!&mdash;temptation-proof.</p>
<p class="i1">Then was I led to vengeful monks, who mix</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>With nymphs and swains, and play unpriestly tricks;             </p>
<p>Then view'd banditti, who in forest wide,</p>
<p>And cavern vast, indignant virgins hide;</p>
<p>Who, hemm'd with bands of sturdiest rogues about,</p>
<p>Find some strange succour, and come virgins out.</p>
<p class="i1">I've watch'd a wint'ry night on castle-walls;</p>
<p>I've stalk'd by moonlight through deserted halls;</p>
<p>And, when the weary world was sunk to rest,</p>
<p>I've had such sights as&mdash;may not be express'd.</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! that chateau, the western tower decay'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>The peasants shun it&mdash;they are all afraid;                      </p>
<p>For there was done a deed!&mdash;could walls reveal,</p>
<p>Or timbers tell it, how the heart would feel!</p>
<a name="Page_472" id="Page_472" class="pagenum">[Pg 472]</a>
<p>Most horrid was it:&mdash;for, behold, the floor</p>
<p>Has stain of blood, and will be clean no more.</p>
<p>Hark to the winds! which through the wide saloon</p>
<p>And the long passage send a dismal <span class="locked">tune&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Music that ghosts delight in;&mdash;and now heed</p>
<p>Yon beauteous nymph, who must unmask the deed.</p>
<p>See! with majestic sweep she swims alone</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Through rooms, all dreary, guided by a groan;                   </p>
<p>Though windows rattle, and though tap'stries shake,</p>
<p>And the feet falter every step they take,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>'Mid groans and gibing sprights she silent goes,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>To find a something, which will soon expose                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The villanies and wiles of her determined foes;                </p>
<p>And, having thus adventured, thus endured,</p>
<p>Fame, wealth, and lover, are for life secured.</p>
<p class="i1">Much have I fear'd, but am no more afraid,</p>
<p>When some chaste beauty, by some wretch betray'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>Is drawn away with such distracted speed,                       </p>
<p>That she anticipates a dreadful <span class="locked">deed;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Not so do I.&mdash;Let solid walls impound</p>
<p>The captive fair, and dig a moat around;</p>
<p>Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel,</p>
<p>And keepers cruel, such as never feel;</p>
<p>With not a single note the purse supply,</p>
<p>And when she begs, let men and maids deny;</p>
<p>Be windows those from which she dares not fall,</p>
<p>And help so distant, 'tis in vain to call;</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Still means of freedom will some power devise,                  </p>
<p>And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize.</p>
<p class="i1">To Northern Wales, in some sequester'd spot,</p>
<p>I've followed fair Louisa to her cot;</p>
<p>Where, then a wretched and deserted bride,</p>
<p>The injured fair-one wish'd from man to hide;</p>
<p>Till by her fond repenting Belville found,</p>
<p>By some kind chance&mdash;the straying of a <span class="locked">hound&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He at her feet craved mercy, nor in vain;</p>
<p>For the relenting dove flew back again.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p class="i1">There's something rapturous in distress, or, oh!     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Could Clementina bear her lot of wo?                         </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or what she underwent could maiden undergo?                    </p>
<a name="Page_473" id="Page_473" class="pagenum">[Pg 473]</a>
<p>The day was fix'd; for so the lover sigh'd,</p>
<p>So knelt and craved, he couldn't be denied;</p>
<p>When, tale most dreadful! every hope <span class="locked">adieu&mdash;</span></p>
<p>For the fond lover is the brother too:</p>
<p>All other griefs abate; this monstrous grief</p>
<p>Has no remission, comfort, or relief;</p>
<p>Four ample volumes, through each page <span class="locked">disclose&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Good Heaven protect us!&mdash;only woes on woes;                    </p>
<p>Till some strange means afford a sudden view</p>
<p>Of some vile plot, and every wo adieu!<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p class="i1">Now, should we grant these beauties all endure</p>
<p>Severest pangs, they've still the speediest cure,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Before one charm be wither'd from the face,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Except the bloom, which shall again have place,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>In wedlock ends each wish, in triumph all disgrace;            </p>
<p>And life to come we fairly may suppose</p>
<p>One light, bright contrast to these wild dark woes.</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i1">These let us leave, and at her sorrows look,       </p>
<p>Too often seen, but seldom in a book;</p>
<p>Let her who felt, relate them.&mdash;On her chair</p>
<p>The heroine sits&mdash;in former years the fair,</p>
<p>Now aged and poor; but Ellen Orford knows,</p>
<p>That we should humbly take what Heav'n bestows.</p>
<p class="i1">"My father died&mdash;again my mother wed,</p>
<p>And found the comforts of her life were fled;</p>
<p>Her angry husband, vex'd through half his years</p>
<p>By loss and troubles, fill'd her soul with fears;</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Their children many, and 'twas my poor place                   </p>
<p>To nurse and wait on all the infant-race;</p>
<p>Labour and hunger were indeed my part,</p>
<p>And should have strengthen'd an erroneous heart.</p>
<p class="i1">"Sore was the grief to see him angry come,</p>
<p>And, teased with business, make distress at home;</p>
<p>The father's fury and the children's cries</p>
<p>I soon could bear, but not my mother's sighs;</p>
<p>For she look'd back on comforts, and would say,</p>
<p>'I wrong'd thee, Ellen,' and then turn away.</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Thus for my age's good, my youth was tried,                    </p>
<p>And this my fortune till my mother died.</p>
<p class="i1">"So, amid sorrow much and little <span class="locked">cheer&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_474" id="Page_474" class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</a>
<p>A common case&mdash;I pass'd my twentieth year;</p>
<p>For these are frequent evils; thousands share</p>
<p>An equal grief&mdash;the like domestic care.</p>
<p class="i1">"Then in my days of bloom, of health and youth,</p>
<p>One, much above me, vow'd his love and truth.</p>
<p>We often met, he dreading to be seen,</p>
<p>And much I question'd what such dread might mean;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Yet I believed him true; my simple heart                       </p>
<p>And undirected reason took his part.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"Can he who loves me, whom I love, deceive?   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Can I such wrong of one so kind believe,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Who lives but in my smile, who trembles when I grieve?         </p>
<p class="i1">"He dared not marry, but we met to prove</p>
<p>What sad encroachments and deceits has love:</p>
<p>Weak that I was, when he, rebuked, withdrew,</p>
<p>I let him see that I was wretched too;</p>
<p>When less my caution, I had still the pain</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Of his or mine own weakness to complain.                       </p>
<p class="i1">"Happy the lovers class'd alike in life,</p>
<p>Or happier yet the rich endowing wife;</p>
<p>But most aggrieved the fond believing maid,</p>
<p>Of her rich lover tenderly afraid.</p>
<p>You judge th' event; for grievous was my fate,</p>
<p>Painful to feel, and shameful to relate:</p>
<p>Ah! sad it was my burthen to sustain,</p>
<p>When the least misery was the dread of pain;</p>
<p>When I have grieving told him my disgrace,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>And plainly mark'd indifference in his face.                   </p>
<p class="i1">"Hard! with these fears and terrors to behold</p>
<p>The cause of all, the faithless lover cold;</p>
<p>Impatient grown at every wish denied,</p>
<p>And barely civil, soothed and gratified;</p>
<p>Peevish when urged to think of vows so strong,</p>
<p>And angry when I spake of crime and wrong.</p>
<p class="i1">"All this I felt, and still the sorrow grew,</p>
<p>Because I felt that I deserved it too,</p>
<p>And begg'd my infant stranger to forgive</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>The mother's shame, which in herself must live.                </p>
<p class="i1">"When known that shame, I, soon expell'd from home,</p>
<p>With a frail sister shared a hovel's gloom;</p>
<a name="Page_475" id="Page_475" class="pagenum">[Pg 475]</a>
<p>There barely fed&mdash;(what could I more request?)&mdash;</p>
<p>My infant slumberer sleeping at my breast;</p>
<p>I from my window saw his blooming bride,</p>
<p>And my seducer smiling at her side;</p>
<p>Hope lived till then; I sank upon the floor,</p>
<p>And grief and thought and feeling were no more.</p>
<p>Although revived, I judged that life would close,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And went to rest, to wonder that I rose:                       </p>
<p>My dreams were dismal; wheresoe'er I stray'd,</p>
<p>I seem'd ashamed, alarm'd, despised, betray'd;</p>
<p>Always in grief, in guilt, disgraced, forlorn,</p>
<p>Mourning that one so weak, so vile, was born;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>The earth a desert, tumult in the sea,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The birds affrighted fled from tree to tree,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Obscured the setting sun, and every thing like me;             </p>
<p>But Heav'n had mercy, and my need at length</p>
<p>Urged me to labour and renew'd my strength.</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p class="i1">"I strove for patience as a sinner must,         </p>
<p>Yet felt th' opinion of the world unjust:</p>
<p>There was my lover, in his joy, esteem'd,</p>
<p>And I, in my distress, as guilty deem'd;</p>
<p>Yet sure, not all the guilt and shame belong</p>
<p>To her who feels and suffers for the wrong.</p>
<p>The cheat at play may use the wealth he's won,</p>
<p>But is not honour'd for the mischief done;</p>
<p>The cheat in love may use each villain-art,</p>
<p>And boast the deed that breaks the victim's heart.</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p class="i1">"Four years were past; I might again have found     </p>
<p>Some erring wish, but for another wound:</p>
<p>Lovely my daughter grew, her face was fair;</p>
<p>But no expression ever brighten'd there.</p>
<p>I doubted long, and vainly strove to make</p>
<p>Some certain meaning of the words she spake;</p>
<p>But meaning there was none, and I survey'd</p>
<p>With dread the beauties of my idiot-maid.</p>
<p class="i1">"Still I submitted;&mdash;Oh! 'tis meet and fit</p>
<p>In all we feel to make the heart submit;</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Gloomy and calm my days, but I had then,                       </p>
<p>It seem'd, attractions for the eyes of men.</p>
<p>The sober master of a decent trade</p>
<a name="Page_476" id="Page_476" class="pagenum">[Pg 476]</a>
<p>O'erlook'd my errors, and his offer made;</p>
<p>Reason assented;&mdash;true, my heart denied,</p>
<p>'But thou,' I said, 'shalt be no more my guide.'</p>
<p class="i1">"When wed, our toil and trouble, pains and care,</p>
<p>Of means to live procured us humble share;</p>
<p>Five were our sons,&mdash;and we, though careful, found</p>
<p>Our hopes declining as the year came round;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>For I perceived, yet would not soon perceive,                  </p>
<p>My husband stealing from my view to grieve;</p>
<p>Silent he grew, and when he spoke he sigh'd,</p>
<p>And surly look'd and peevishly replied.</p>
<p>Pensive by nature, he had gone of late</p>
<p>To those who preach'd of destiny and fate,</p>
<p>Of things fore-doom'd, and of election-grace,</p>
<p>And how in vain we strive to run our race;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>That all by works and moral worth we gain                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Is to perceive our care and labour vain;                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>That still the more we pay, our debts the more remain;         </p>
<p>That he who feels not the mysterious call,</p>
<p>Lies bound in sin, still grov'ling from the fall.</p>
<p>My husband felt not;&mdash;our persuasion, prayer,</p>
<p>And our best reason darken'd his despair;</p>
<p>His very nature changed; he now reviled</p>
<p>My former conduct&mdash;he reproach'd my child;</p>
<p>He talk'd of bastard slips, and cursed his bed,</p>
<p>And from our kindness to concealment fled;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>For ever to some evil change inclined,                       </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>To every gloomy thought he lent his mind,                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Nor rest would give to us, nor rest himself could find;        </p>
<p>His son suspended saw him, long bereft</p>
<p>Of life, nor prospect of revival left.</p>
<p class="i1">"With him died all our prospects, and once more</p>
<p>I shared th' allotments of the parish poor;</p>
<p>They took my children too, and this I know</p>
<p>Was just and lawful, but I felt the blow;</p>
<p>My idiot-maid and one unhealthy boy</p>
<p>Were left, a mother's misery and her joy.</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p class="i1">"Three sons I follow'd to the grave, and one&mdash;      </p>
<p>Oh! can I speak of that unhappy son?</p>
<p>Would all the memory of that time were fled,</p>
<a name="Page_477" id="Page_477" class="pagenum">[Pg 477]</a>
<p>And all those horrors, with my child, were dead!</p>
<p>Before the world seduced him, what a grace</p>
<p>And smile of gladness shone upon his face!</p>
<p>Then he had knowledge; finely would he write;</p>
<p>Study to him was pleasure and delight;</p>
<p>Great was his courage, and but few could stand</p>
<p>Against the sleight and vigour of his hand;</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>The maidens loved him;&mdash;when he came to die,                   </p>
<p>No, not the coldest could suppress a sigh.</p>
<p>Here I must cease&mdash;how can I say, my child</p>
<p>Was by the bad of either sex beguiled?</p>
<p>Worst of the bad&mdash;they taught him that the laws</p>
<p>Made wrong and right; there was no other cause;</p>
<p>That all religion was the trade of priests,</p>
<p>And men, when dead, must perish like the <span class="locked">beasts;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And he, so lively and so gay <span class="locked">before&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Ah! spare a mother&mdash;I can tell no more.</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p class="i1">"Int'rest was made that they should not destroy     </p>
<p>The comely form of my deluded <span class="locked">boy&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But pardon came not; damp the place and deep</p>
<p>Where he was kept, as they'd a tiger keep;</p>
<p>For he, unhappy! had before them all</p>
<p>Vow'd he'd escape, whatever might befall.</p>
<p class="i1">"He'd means of dress, and dress'd beyond his means,</p>
<p>And, so to see him in such dismal scenes,</p>
<p>I cannot speak it&mdash;cannot bear to tell</p>
<p>Of that sad hour&mdash;I heard the passing-bell!</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p class="i1">"Slowly they went; he smiled and look'd so smart,    </p>
<p>Yet sure he shudder'd when he saw the cart,</p>
<p>And gave a look&mdash;until my dying-day,</p>
<p>That look will never from my mind away;</p>
<p>Oft as I sit, and ever in my dreams,</p>
<p>I see that look, and they have heard my screams.</p>
<p class="i1">"Now let me speak no more&mdash;yet all declared</p>
<p>That one so young, in pity should be spared,</p>
<p>And one so manly;&mdash;on his graceful neck,</p>
<p>That chains of jewels may be proud to deck,</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>To a small mole a mother's lips have press'd&mdash;                 </p>
<p>And there the cord&mdash;my breath is sore oppress'd.</p>
<p class="i1">"I now can speak again:&mdash;my elder boy</p>
<a name="Page_478" id="Page_478" class="pagenum">[Pg 478]</a>
<p>Was that year drown'd&mdash;a seaman in a hoy.</p>
<p>He left a numerous race; of these would some</p>
<p>In their young troubles to my cottage come;</p>
<p>And these I taught&mdash;an humble teacher <span class="locked">I&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Upon their heavenly Parent to rely.</p>
<p class="i1">"Alas! I needed such reliance <span class="locked">more:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>My idiot-girl, so simply gay before,</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>Now wept in pain; some wretch had found a time,                </p>
<p>Depraved and wicked, for that coward-crime;</p>
<p>I had indeed my doubt, but I suppress'd</p>
<p>The thought that day and night disturb'd my rest;</p>
<p>She and that sick-pale brother&mdash;but why strive</p>
<p>To keep the terrors of that time alive?</p>
<p class="i1">"The hour arrived, the new, th' undreaded pain,</p>
<p>That came with violence and yet came in vain.</p>
<p>I saw her die; her brother too is dead,</p>
<p>Nor own'd such crime&mdash;what is it that I dread?</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p class="i1">"The parish-aid withdrawn, I look'd around,       </p>
<p>And in my school a bless'd subsistence <span class="locked">found&mdash;</span></p>
<p>My winter-calm of life: to be of use</p>
<p>Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce;</p>

<p>The various trials of their riper age,</p>

<p>As this incident points out the work alluded to, I wish it to be remembered, that the
gloomy tenour, the querulous melancholy of the story, is all I censure. The language of
the writer is often animated, and is, I believe, correct; the characters well drawn, and
the manners described from real life; but the perpetual occurrence of sad events, the
protracted list of teasing and perplexing mischances, joined with much waspish invective,
unallayed by pleasantry or sprightliness, and these continued through many hundred
pages, render publications, intended for amusement and executed with ability, heavy and
displeasing;&mdash;you find your favourite persons happy in the end; but they have teased
you so much with their perplexities by the way, that you were frequently disposed to quit
them in their distresses.</p>

<p class="semiheader">LETTER XXI.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">ABEL KEENE.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="i1">A quiet simple man was Abel Keene;</p>
<p>He meant no harm, nor did he often mean.</p>
<p>He kept a school of loud rebellious boys,</p>
<p>And growing old, grew nervous with the noise;</p>
<p>When a kind merchant hired his useful pen,</p>
<p>And made him happiest of accompting men;</p>
<p>With glee he rose to every easy day,</p>
<p>When half the labour brought him twice the pay.</p>
<p class="i1">There were young clerks, and there the merchant's son,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Choice spirits all, who wish'd him to be one;                   </p>
<p>It must, no question, give them lively joy,</p>
<p>Hopes long indulged, to combat and destroy;</p>
<p>At these they level'd all their skill and <span class="locked">strength&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He fell not quickly, but he fell at length.</p>
<p>They quoted books, to him both bold and new,</p>
<p>And scorn'd as fables all he held as <span class="locked">true&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Such monkish stories and such nursery lies,"</p>
<p>That he was struck with terror and surprise.</p>
<p class="i1">"What! all his life had he the laws obey'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Which they broke through and were not once afraid?              </p>
<p>Had he so long his evil passions check'd,</p>
<a name="Page_482" id="Page_482" class="pagenum">[Pg 482]</a>
<p>And yet at last had nothing to expect?</p>
<p>While they their lives in joy and pleasure led,</p>
<p>And then had nothing, at the end, to dread?</p>
<p>Was all his priest with so much zeal convey'd,</p>
<p>A part! a speech! for which the man was paid?</p>
<p>And were his pious books, his solemn prayers,</p>
<p>Not worth one tale of the admired Voltaire's?</p>
<p>Then was it time, while yet some years remain'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>To drink untroubled and to think unchain'd,                     </p>
<p>And on all pleasures, which his purse could give,</p>
<p>Freely to seize, and while he lived, to live."</p>
<p class="i1">Much time he passed in this important strife,</p>
<p>The bliss or bane of his remaining life;</p>
<p>For converts all are made with care and grief,</p>
<p>And pangs attend the birth of unbelief;</p>
<p>Nor pass they soon;&mdash;with awe and fear he took</p>
<p>The flow'ry way, and cast back many a look.</p>
<p class="i1">The youths applauded much his wise design,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>With weighty reasoning o'er their evening wine;                 </p>
<p>And much in private 'twould their mirth improve,</p>
<p>To hear how Abel spake of life and love;</p>
<p>To hear him own what grievous pains it cost,</p>
<p>Ere the old saint was in the sinner lost;</p>
<p>Ere his poor mind with every deed alarm'd,</p>
<p>By wit was settled, and by vice was charm'd.</p>
<p class="i1">For Abel enter'd in his bold career,</p>
<p>Like boys on ice, with pleasure and with fear;</p>
<p>Lingering, yet longing for the joy, he went,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>Repenting now, now dreading to repent;                          </p>
<p>With awkward pace, and with himself at war,</p>
<p>Far gone, yet frighten'd that he went so far;</p>
<p>Oft for his efforts he'd solicit praise,</p>
<p>And then proceed with blunders and delays.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>The young more aptly passion's calls pursue,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>But age and weakness start at scenes so new,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And tremble when they've done, for all they dared to do.       </p>
<p class="i1">At length example Abel's dread removed;</p>
<p>With small concern he sought the joys he loved;</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Not resting here, he claim'd his share of fame,                 </p>
<p>And first their votary, then their wit became;</p>
<a name="Page_483" id="Page_483" class="pagenum">[Pg 483]</a>
<p>His jest was bitter and his satire bold,</p>
<p>When he his tales of formal brethren told,</p>
<p>What time with pious neighbours he discuss'd,</p>
<p>Their boasted treasure and their boundless trust:</p>
<p>"Such were our dreams," the jovial elder cried;</p>
<p>"Awake and live," his youthful friends replied.</p>
<p class="i1">Now the gay clerk a modest drab despised,</p>
<p>And clad him smartly as his friends advised;</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>So fine a coat upon his back he threw,                          </p>
<p>That not an alley-boy old Abel knew;</p>
<p>Broad polish'd buttons blazed that coat upon,</p>
<p>And just beneath the watch's trinkets <span class="locked">shone&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A splendid watch, that pointed out the time,</p>
<p>To fly from business and make free with crime.</p>
<p>The crimson waistcoat and the silken hose</p>
<p>Rank'd the lean man among the Borough beaux;</p>
<p>His raven hair he cropp'd with fierce disdain,</p>
<p>And light elastic locks encased his brain:</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>More pliant pupil who could hope to find,                       </p>
<p>So deck'd in person and so changed in mind?</p>
<p class="i1">When Abel walk'd the streets, with pleasant mien</p>
<p>He met his friends, delighted to be seen;</p>
<p>And, when he rode along the public way,</p>
<p>No beau so gaudy and no youth so gay.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">His pious sister, now an ancient maid,     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>For Abel fearing, first in secret pray'd;                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Then thus in love and scorn her notions she convey'd:         </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"Alas! my brother! can I see thee pace      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Hoodwink'd to hell, and not lament thy case,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Nor stretch my feeble hand to stop thy headlong race?          </p>
<p>Lo! thou art bound; a slave in Satan's chain,</p>
<p>The righteous Abel turn'd the wretched Cain;</p>
<p>His brother's blood against the murderer cried;</p>
<p>Against thee thine, unhappy suicide!</p>
<p>Are all our pious nights and peaceful days,</p>
<p>Our evening readings and our morning praise,</p>
<p>Our spirits' comfort in the trials sent,</p>
<p>Our hearts' rejoicings in the blessings lent,</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>All that o'er grief a cheering influence shed&mdash;                </p>
<p>Are these for ever and for ever fled?</p>
<a name="Page_484" id="Page_484" class="pagenum">[Pg 484]</a>
<p class="i1">"When in the years gone by, the trying years,</p>
<p>When faith and hope had strife with wants and fears,</p>
<p>Thy nerves have trembled till thou couldst not eat</p>
<p>(Dress'd by this hand) thy mess of simple meat;</p>
<p>When, grieved by fastings, gall'd by fates severe,</p>
<p>Slow pass'd the days of the successless year;</p>
<p>Still in these gloomy hours, my brother then</p>
<p>Had glorious views, unseen by prosperous men:</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>And when thy heart has felt its wish denied,                   </p>
<p>What gracious texts hast thou to grief applied;</p>
<p>Till thou hast enter'd in thine humble bed,</p>
<p>By lofty hopes and heavenly musings fed;</p>
<p>Then I have seen thy lively looks express</p>
<p>The spirit's comforts in the man's distress.</p>
<p class="i1">"Then didst thou cry, exulting, 'Yes, 'tis fit,</p>
<p>'Tis meet and right, my heart! that we submit;'</p>
<p>And wilt thou, Abel, thy new pleasures weigh</p>
<p>Against such triumphs?&mdash;Oh! repent and pray.</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i1">"What are thy pleasures?&mdash;with the gay to sit,      </p>
<p>And thy poor brain torment for awkward wit;</p>
<p>All thy good thoughts (thou hat'st them) to restrain,</p>
<p>And give a wicked pleasure to the vain;</p>
<p>Thy long lean frame by fashion to attire,</p>
<p>That lads may laugh and wantons may admire;</p>
<p>To raise the mirth of boys, and not to see,</p>
<p>Unhappy maniac! that they laugh at thee.</p>
<p class="i1">"These boyish follies, which alone the boy</p>
<p>Can idly act or gracefully enjoy,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Add new reproaches to thy fallen state,                        </p>
<p>And make men scorn what they would only hate.</p>
<p class="i1">"What pains, my brother, dost thou take to prove</p>
<p>A taste for follies which thou canst not love!</p>
<p>Why do thy stiffening limbs the steed <span class="locked">bestride&mdash;</span></p>
<p>That lads may laugh to see thou canst not ride?</p>
<p>And why (I feel the crimson tinge my cheek)</p>
<p>Dost thou by night in Diamond-Alley sneak?</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"Farewell! the parish will thy sister keep,   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Where she in peace shall pray and sing and sleep,            </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>Save when for thee she mourns, thou wicked, wandering sheep!   </p>
<a name="Page_485" id="Page_485" class="pagenum">[Pg 485]</a>
<p>When youth is fall'n, there's hope the young may rise,</p>
<p>But fallen age for ever hopeless lies:</p>
<p>Torn up by storms and placed in earth once more,</p>
<p>The younger tree may sun and soil restore;</p>
<p>But when the old and sapless trunk lies low,</p>
<p>No care or soil can former life bestow;</p>
<p>Reserved for burning is the worthless tree;</p>
<p>And what, O Abel! is reserved for thee?"</p>
<p class="i1">These angry words our hero deeply felt,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Though hard his heart, and indisposed to melt!                 </p>
<p>To gain relief he took a glass the more,</p>
<p>And, then went on as careless as before;</p>
<p>Thenceforth, uncheck'd, amusements he partook,</p>
<p>And (save his ledger) saw no decent book;</p>
<p>Him found the merchant punctual at his task,</p>
<p>And, that perform'd, he'd nothing more to ask;</p>
<p>He cared not how old Abel play'd the fool,</p>
<p>No master he, beyond the hours of school:</p>
<p>Thus they, proceeding, had their wine and joke,</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Till merchant Dixon felt a warning stroke,                     </p>
<p>And, after struggling half a gloomy week,</p>
<p>Left his poor clerk another friend to seek.</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! the son, who led the saint astray,</p>
<p>Forgot the man whose follies made him gay;</p>
<p>He cared no more for Abel in his need,</p>
<p>[Than] Abel cared about his hackney steed;</p>
<p>He now, alas! had all his earnings spent,</p>
<p>And thus was left to languish and repent;</p>
<p>No school nor clerkship found he in the place,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Now lost to fortune, as before to grace.                       </p>
<p class="i1">For town-relief the grieving man applied,</p>
<p>And begg'd with tears what some with scorn denied;</p>
<p>Others look'd down upon the glowing vest,</p>
<p>And, frowning, ask'd him at what price he dress'd?</p>
<p>Happy for him his country's laws are mild,</p>
<p>They must support him, though they still reviled;</p>
<p>Grieved, abject, scorn'd, insulted, and betray'd,</p>
<p>Of God unmindful, and of man <span class="locked">afraid&mdash;</span></p>
<p>No more he talk'd; 'twas pain, 'twas shame to speak,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>His heart was sinking and his frame was weak.                  </p>
<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486" class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</a>
<p>His sister died with such serene delight,</p>
<p>He once again began to think her right;</p>
<p>Poor like himself, the happy spinster lay,</p>
<p>And sweet assurance bless'd her dying-day;</p>
<p>Poor like the spinster, he, when death was nigh,</p>
<p>Assured of nothing, felt afraid to die.</p>
<p>The cheerful clerks who sometimes pass'd the door,</p>
<p>Just mention'd "Abel!" and then thought no more.</p>
<p>So Abel, pondering on his state forlorn,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Look'd round for comfort, and was chased by scorn.             </p>
<p>And now we saw him on the beach reclined,</p>
<p>Or causeless walking in the wint'ry wind;</p>
<p>And, when it raised a loud and angry sea,</p>
<p>He stood and gazed, in wretched reverie;</p>
<p>He heeded not the frost, the rain, the snow;</p>
<p>Close by the sea he walk'd alone and slow.</p>
<p>Sometimes his frame through many an hour he spread</p>
<p>Upon a tombstone, moveless as the dead;</p>
<p>And, was there found a sad and silent place,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>There would he creep with slow and measured pace.              </p>
<p>Then would he wander by the river's side,</p>
<p>And fix his eyes upon the falling tide;</p>
<p>The deep dry ditch, the rushes in the fen,</p>
<p>And mossy crag-pits were his lodgings then:</p>
<p>There, to his discontented thoughts a prey,</p>
<p>The melancholy mortal pined away.</p>
<p class="i1">The neighb'ring poor at length began to speak</p>
<p>Of Abel's ramblings&mdash;he'd been gone a week,</p>
<p>They knew not where; and little care they took</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>For one so friendless and so poor to look;                     </p>
<p>At last a stranger, in a pedler's shed,</p>
<p>Beheld him hanging&mdash;he had long been dead.</p>
<p>He left a paper, penn'd at sundry times,</p>
<p>Intitled thus&mdash;"My Groanings and my Crimes!"</p>
<p class="i1">"I was a christian man, and none could lay</p>
<p>Aught to my charge; I walk'd the narrow way:</p>
<p>All then was simple faith, serene and pure,</p>
<p>My hope was steadfast and my prospects sure;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Then was I tried by want and sickness sore,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>But these I clapp'd my shield of faith before,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<a name="Page_487" id="Page_487" class="pagenum">[Pg 487]</a>
<p>And cares and wants and man's rebukes I bore.                  </p>
<p>Alas! new foes assail'd me; I was vain,</p>
<p>They stung my pride and they confused my brain:</p>
<p>Oh! these deluders! with what glee they saw</p>
<p>Their simple dupe transgress the righteous law;</p>
<p>'Twas joy to them to view that dreadful strife,</p>
<p>When faith and frailty warr'd for more than life;</p>
<p>So with their pleasures they beguiled the heart,</p>
<p>Then with their logic they allay'd the smart;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>They proved (so thought I then) with reasons strong,           </p>
<p>That no man's feelings ever led him wrong;</p>
<p>And thus I went, as on the varnish'd ice,</p>
<p>The smooth career of unbelief and vice.</p>
<p>Oft would the youths, with sprightly speech and bold,</p>
<p>Their witty tales of naughty priests unfold;</p>
<p>''Twas all a craft,' they said, 'a cunning trade,</p>
<p>Not she the priests, but priests religion made:'</p>
<p>So I believed;"&mdash;No, Abel! to thy grief,</p>
<p>So thou relinquish'dst all that was <span class="locked">belief;&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>"I grew as very flint, and when the rest                       </p>
<p>Laugh'd at devotion, I enjoy'd the jest;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>But this all vanish'd like the morning-dew,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>When unemploy'd, and poor again I grew;                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Yea! I was doubly poor, for I was wicked too.                  </p>
<p class="i1">"The mouse that trespass'd and the treasure stole,</p>
<p>Found his lean body fitted to the hole;</p>
<p>Till, having fatted, he was forced to stay,</p>
<p>And, fasting, starve his stolen bulk away.</p>
<p>Ah! worse for me&mdash;grown poor, I yet remain</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>In sinful bonds, and pray and fast in vain.                    </p>
<p class="i1">"At length I thought: although these friends of sin</p>
<p>Have spread their net and caught their prey therein;</p>
<p>Though my hard heart could not for mercy call,</p>
<p>Because, though great my grief, my faith was small;</p>
<p>Yet, as the sick on skilful men rely,</p>
<p>The soul diseased may to a doctor fly.</p>
<p class="i1">"A famous one there was, whose skill had wrought</p>
<p>Cures past relief, and him the sinners sought;</p>
<p>Numbers there were denied by mire and filth,</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Whom he recover'd by his goodly tilth:&mdash;                       </p>
<a name="Page_488" id="Page_488" class="pagenum">[Pg 488]</a>
<p>'Come then,' I said, 'let me the man behold,</p>
<p>And tell my case;'&mdash;I saw him and I told.</p>
<p class="i1">"With trembling voice, 'Oh! reverend sir,' I said,</p>
<p>'I once believed, and I was then misled;</p>
<p>And now such doubts my sinful soul beset,</p>
<p>I dare not say that I'm a Christian yet;</p>
<p>Canst thou, good sir, by thy superior skill,</p>
<p>Inform my judgment and direct my will?</p>
<p>Ah! give thy cordial; let my soul have rest,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>And be the outward man alone distress'd;                       </p>
<p>For at my state I tremble.'&mdash;'Tremble more,'</p>
<p>Said the good man, 'and then rejoice therefore;</p>
<p>'Tis good to tremble; prospects then are fair,</p>
<p>When the lost soul is plunged in deep despair.</p>
<p>Once thou wert simply honest, just and pure,</p>
<p>Whole, as thou thought'st, and never wish'd a cure;</p>
<p>Now thou hast plunged in folly, shame, disgrace;</p>
<p>Now thou'rt an object meet for healing grace;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>No merit thine, no virtue, hope, belief;                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>Nothing hast thou, but misery, sin, and grief,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The best, the only titles to relief.'                          </p>
<p class="i1">"'What must I do,' I said, 'my soul to free?'</p>

<p><i>But take thy part with sinners and be still.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In a periodical work for the month of June last, the preceding dialogue is pronounced to
be a most abominable caricature, if meant to be applied to Calvinists in general, and
greatly distorted, if designed for an individual. Now, the author in his preface has
declared, that he takes not upon him the censure of any sect or society for their
opinions; and the lines themselves evidently point to an individual, whose sentiments they
very fairly represent, without any distortion whatsoever. In a pamphlet entitled "A
Cordial for a Sin-despairing Soul," originally written by a teacher of religion, and
lately re-published by another teacher of greater notoriety, the reader is informed that
after he had full assurance of his salvation, the Spirit entered particularly into the
subject with him; and, among many other matters of like nature, assured him that "his sins
were fully and freely forgiven, as if they had never been committed: not for any act done
by him, whether believing in Christ, or repenting of sin; nor yet for the sorrows and
miseries he endured, nor for any service he should be called upon in his militant state,
but for his own name and for his glory's sake<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"
href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>," &amp;c. And the whole drift and tenour of the
book is to the same purpose, viz. the uselessness of all religious duties, such as prayer,
contrition, fasting, and good works: he shows the evil done by reading such books as the
Whole Duty of Man, and the Practice of Piety; and complains heavily of his relation, an
Irish bishop, who wanted him to join with the household in family prayer: in fact, the
whole work inculcates that sort of quietism which this dialogue alludes to, and that
without any recommendation of attendance on the teachers of the Gospel, but rather holding
forth encouragement to the supineness of man's nature; by the information that he in vain
looks for acceptance by the employment of his talents, and that his hopes of glory are
rather extinguished than raised by any application to the means of grace.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">PETER GRIMES.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">Old Peter Grimes made fishing his employ;    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>His wife he cabin'd with him and his boy,                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And seem'd that life laborious to enjoy.                       </p>
<p>To town came quiet Peter with his fish,</p>
<p>And had of all a civil word and wish.</p>
<p>He left his trade upon the sabbath-day,</p>
<p>And took young Peter in his hand to pray;</p>
<p>But soon the stubborn boy from care broke loose,</p>
<p>At first refused, then added his abuse;</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>His father's love he scorn'd, his power defied,                 </p>
<p>But, being drunk, wept sorely when he died.</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! then he wept, and to his mind there came</p>
<p>Much of his conduct, and he felt the <span class="locked">shame:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>How he had oft the good old man reviled,</p>
<p>And never paid the duty of a child;</p>
<p>How, when the father in his Bible read,</p>
<p>He in contempt and anger left the shed;</p>
<p>"It is the word of life," the parent cried;</p>
<p>&mdash;"This is the life itself," the boy replied;</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>And while old Peter in amazement stood,                         </p>
<p>Gave the hot spirit to his boiling <span class="locked">blood;&mdash;</span></p>
<a name="Page_493" id="Page_493" class="pagenum">[Pg 493]</a>
<p>How he, with oath and furious speech, began</p>
<p>To prove his freedom and assert the man;</p>
<p>And when the parent check'd his impious rage,</p>
<p>How he had cursed the tyranny of <span class="locked">age;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Nay, once had dealt the sacrilegious blow</p>
<p>On his bare head, and laid his parent low;</p>
<p>The father groan'd&mdash;"If thou art old," said he,</p>
<p>"And hast a son&mdash;thou wilt remember me;</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>Thy mother left me in a happy time,                             </p>
<p>Thou kill'dst not her&mdash;Heav'n spares the double crime."</p>
<p class="i1">On an inn-settle, in his maudlin grief,</p>
<p>This he revolved, and drank for his relief.</p>
<p class="i1">Now lived the youth in freedom, but debarr'd</p>
<p>From constant pleasure, and he thought it hard;</p>
<p>Hard that he could not every wish obey,</p>
<p>But must awhile relinquish ale and play;</p>
<p>Hard! that he could not to his cards attend,</p>
<p>But must acquire the money he would spend.</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p class="i1">With greedy eye he look'd on all he saw;         </p>
<p>He knew not justice, and he laugh'd at law;</p>
<p>On all he mark'd he stretch'd his ready hand;</p>
<p>He fish'd by water, and he filch'd by land.</p>
<p>Oft in the night has Peter dropp'd his oar,</p>
<p>Fled from his boat and sought for prey on shore;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Oft up the hedge-row glided, on his back                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Bearing the orchard's produce in a sack,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or farm-yard load, tugg'd fiercely from the stack;             </p>
<p>And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose,</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>The more he look'd on all men as his foes.                      </p>
<p class="i1">He built a mud-wall'd hovel, where he kept</p>
<p>His various wealth, and there he oft-times slept;</p>
<p>But no success could please his cruel soul,</p>
<p>He wish'd for one to trouble and control;</p>
<p>He wanted some obedient boy to stand</p>
<p>And bear the blow of his outrageous hand;</p>
<p>And hoped to find in some propitious hour</p>
<p>A feeling creature subject to his power.</p>
<p class="i1">Peter had heard there were in London <span class="locked">then&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Still have they being!&mdash;workhouse-clearing men,                 </p>
<p>Who, undisturb'd by feelings just or kind,</p>
<a name="Page_494" id="Page_494" class="pagenum">[Pg 494]</a>
<p>Would parish-boys to needy tradesmen bind;</p>
<p>They in their want a trifling sum would take,</p>
<p>And toiling slaves of piteous orphans make.</p>
<p class="i1">Such Peter sought, and, when a lad was found,</p>
<p>The sum was dealt him, and the slave was bound.</p>
<p>Some few in town observed in Peter's trap</p>
<p>A boy, with jacket blue and woollen cap;</p>
<p>But none inquired how Peter used the rope,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Or what the bruise, that made the stripling stoop;              </p>
<p>None could the ridges on his back behold,</p>
<p>None sought him shiv'ring in the winter's cold;</p>
<p>None put the question&mdash;"Peter, dost thou give</p>
<p>The boy his food?&mdash;What, man! the lad must live:</p>
<p>Consider, Peter, let the child have bread,</p>
<p>He'll serve thee better if he's stroked and fed."</p>
<p>None reason'd thus&mdash;and some, on hearing cries,</p>
<p>Said calmly, "Grimes is at his exercise."</p>
<p class="i1">Pinn'd, beaten, cold, pinch'd, threaten'd, and <span class="locked">abused&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>His efforts punish'd and his food refused&mdash;                     </p>
<p>Awake tormented&mdash;soon aroused from <span class="locked">sleep&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Struck if he wept, and yet compell'd to weep:</p>
<p>The trembling boy dropp'd down and strove to pray,</p>
<p>Received a blow, and trembling turn'd away,</p>
<p>Or sobb'd and hid his piteous face;&mdash;while he,</p>
<p>The savage master, grinn'd in horrid glee:</p>
<p>He'd now the power he ever loved to show,</p>
<p>A feeling being subject to his blow.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus lived the lad, in hunger, peril, pain,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>His tears despised, his supplications vain.                     </p>
<p>Compell'd by fear to lie, by need to steal,</p>
<p>His bed uneasy and unbless'd his meal,</p>
<p>For three sad years the boy his tortures bore;</p>
<p>And then his pains and trials were no more.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"How died he, Peter?" when the people said,   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>He growl'd&mdash;"I found him lifeless in his bed;"               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Then tried for softer tone, and sigh'd, "Poor Sam is dead."    </p>
<p>Yet murmurs were there, and some questions <span class="locked">ask'd&mdash;</span></p>
<p>How he was fed, how punish'd, and how task'd?</p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Much they suspected, but they little proved,                   </p>
<p>And Peter pass'd untroubled and unmoved.</p>
<a name="Page_495" id="Page_495" class="pagenum">[Pg 495]</a>
<p class="i1">Another boy with equal ease was found,</p>
<p>The money granted, and the victim bound;</p>
<p>And what his fate?&mdash;One night, it chanced he fell</p>
<p>From the boat's mast and perish'd in her well,</p>
<p>Where fish were living kept, and where the boy</p>
<p>(So reason'd men) could not himself destroy.</p>
<p class="i1">0.5</p>
<p>(For he was idle both by night and day,)</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>He climb'd the main-mast and then fell below;"&mdash;               </p>
<p>Then show'd his corpse and pointed to the <span class="locked">blow;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"What said the jury?"&mdash;They were long in doubt;</p>
<p>But sturdy Peter faced the matter out:</p>
<p>So they dismiss'd him, saying at the time,</p>
<p>"Keep fast your hatchway, when you've boys who climb."</p>
<p>This hit the conscience, and he colour'd more</p>
<p>Than for the closest questions put before.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus all his fears the verdict set aside,</p>
<p>And at the slave-shop Peter still applied.</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p class="i1">Then came a boy, of manners soft and mild&mdash;       </p>
<p>Our seamen's wives with grief beheld the child;</p>
<p>All thought (the poor themselves) that he was one</p>
<p>Of gentle blood, some noble sinner's son,</p>
<p>Who had, belike, deceived some humble maid,</p>
<p>Whom he had first seduced and then <span class="locked">betray'd.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>However this, he seem'd a gracious lad,</p>
<p>In grief submissive and with patience sad.</p>
<p class="i1">Passive he labour'd, till his slender frame</p>
<p>Bent with his loads, and he at length was <span class="locked">lame;&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long                </p>
<p>The grossest insult and the foulest wrong;</p>
<p>But there were causes&mdash;in the town they gave</p>
<p>Fire, food, and comfort, to the gentle slave;</p>
<p>And though stern Peter, with a cruel hand,</p>
<p>And knotted rope, enforced the rude command,</p>
<p>Yet he consider'd what he'd lately felt,</p>
<p>And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt.</p>
<p class="i1">One day such draughts the cruel fisher made</p>
<p>He could not vend them in his borough-trade,</p>
<div class="linenum">140</div>
<p>But sail'd for London-mart; the boy was ill,                   </p>
<p>But ever humbled to his master's will;</p>
<a name="Page_496" id="Page_496" class="pagenum">[Pg 496]</a>
<p>And on the river, where they smoothly sail'd,</p>
<p>He strove with terror and awhile prevail'd;</p>
<p>But, new to danger on the angry sea,</p>
<p>He clung affrighten'd to his master's knee.</p>
<p>The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong,</p>
<p>Rough was the passage and the time was long;</p>
<p>His liquor fail'd, and Peter's wrath <span class="locked">arose&mdash;</span></p>
<p>No more is known&mdash;the rest we must suppose,</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Or learn of Peter;&mdash;Peter says, he "spied                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The stripling's danger and for harbour tried;                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Meantime the fish, and then th' apprentice died."              </p>
<p class="i1">The pitying women raised a clamour round,</p>
<p>And weeping said, "Thou hast thy 'prentice drown'd."</p>
<p class="i1">Now the stern man was summon'd to the hall,</p>
<p>To tell his tale before the burghers all.</p>
<p>He gave th' account; profess'd the lad he loved,</p>
<p>And kept his brazen features all unmoved.</p>
<p class="i1">The mayor himself with tone severe <span class="locked">replied,&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>"Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide;                   </p>
<p>Hire thee a freeman, whom thou durst not beat,</p>
<p>But who, in thy despite, will sleep and eat.</p>
<p>Free thou art now!&mdash;again shouldst thou appear,</p>
<p>Thou'lt find thy sentence, like thy soul, severe."</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! for Peter not a helping hand,</p>
<p>So was he hated, could he now command;</p>
<p>Alone he row'd his boat; alone he cast</p>
<p>His nets beside, or made his anchor fast;</p>
<p>To hold a rope or hear a curse was <span class="locked">none&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>He toil'd and rail'd; he groan'd and swore alone.              </p>
<p class="i1">Thus by himself compell'd to live each day,</p>
<p>To wait for certain hours the tide's delay;</p>
<p>At the same times the same dull views to see,</p>
<p>The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree;</p>
<p>The water only when the tides were high;</p>
<p>When low, the mud half-cover'd and half-dry;</p>
<p>The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks,</p>
<p>And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks;</p>
<p>Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float,</p>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>As the tide rolls by the impeded boat.                         </p>
<p class="i1">When tides were neap, and, in the sultry day,</p>
<a name="Page_497" id="Page_497" class="pagenum">[Pg 497]</a>
<p>Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way,</p>
<p>Which on each side rose swelling, and below</p>
<p>The dark warm flood ran silently and slow:</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>There anchoring, Peter chose from man to hide,               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>There hang his head, and view the lazy tide                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>In its hot slimy channel slowly glide;                         </p>
<p>Where the small eels that left the deeper way</p>
<p>For the warm shore, within the shallows play;</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Where gaping muscles, left upon the mud,                       </p>
<p>Slope their slow passage to the fallen <span class="locked">flood:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Here dull and hopeless he'd lie down and trace</p>
<p>How sidelong crabs had scrawl'd their crooked race;</p>
<p>Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry</p>
<p>Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come,             </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And the loud bittern, from the bull-rush home,               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Gave from the salt-ditch side the bellowing boom.              </p>
<p>He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And loved to stop beside the opening sluice;                   </p>
<p>Where the small stream, confined in narrow bound,</p>
<p>Ran with a dull, unvaried, sadd'ning sound;</p>
<p>Where all presented to the eye or ear</p>
<p>Oppress'd the soul with misery, grief, and fear.</p>
<p class="i1">Besides these objects, there were places three,</p>
<p>Which Peter seem'd with certain dread to see;</p>
<p>When he drew near them he would turn from each,</p>
<p>And loudly whistle till he pass'd the reach<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>
<p class="i1">A change of scene to him brought no relief;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>In town, 'twas plain, men took him for a thief:                </p>
<p>The sailors' wives would stop him in the street,</p>
<p>And say, "Now, Peter, thou'st no boy to beat;"</p>
<p>Infants at play, when they perceived him, ran,</p>
<p>Warning each other&mdash;"That's the wicked man;"</p>
<p>He growl'd an oath, and in an angry tone</p>
<p>Cursed the whole place and wish'd to be alone.</p>
<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498" class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</a>
<p class="i1">Alone he was, the same dull scenes in view,</p>
<p>And still more gloomy in his sight they grew.</p>
<p>Though man he hated, yet employ'd alone</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>At bootless labour, he would swear and groan,                  </p>
<p>Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot,</p>
<p>And gulls that caught them when his arts could not.</p>
<p class="i1">Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame,</p>
<p>And strange disease&mdash;he couldn't say the name;</p>
<p>Wild were his dreams, and oft he rose in fright,</p>
<p>Waked by his view of horrors in the <span class="locked">night&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Horrors that would the sternest minds amaze,</p>
<p>Horrors that demons might be proud to raise;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>And, though he felt forsaken, grieved at heart,              </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>To think he lived from all mankind apart;                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Yet, if a man approach'd, in terrors he would start.           </p>
<p class="i1">A winter pass'd since Peter saw the town,</p>
<p>And summer-lodgers were again come down;</p>
<p>These, idly curious, with their glasses spied</p>
<p>The ships in bay as anchored for the <span class="locked">tide&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The river's craft&mdash;the bustle of the <span class="locked">quay&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And sea-port views, which landmen love to see.</p>
<p class="i1">One, up the river, had a man and boat</p>
<p>Seen day by day, now anchor'd, now afloat;</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Fisher he seem'd, yet used no net nor hook;                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Of sea-fowl swimming by no heed he took,                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>But on the gliding waves still fix'd his lazy look;            </p>
<p>At certain stations he would view the stream,</p>
<p>As if he stood bewilder'd in a dream,</p>
<p>Or that some power had chain'd him for a time,</p>
<p>To feel a curse or meditate on crime.</p>
<p class="i1">This known, some curious, some in pity went,</p>
<p>And others question'd&mdash;"Wretch, dost thou repent?"</p>
<p>He heard, he trembled, and in fear resign'd</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>His boat; new terror fill'd his restless mind;                 </p>
<p>Furious he grew, and up the country ran,</p>
<p>And there they seized him&mdash;a distemper'd <span class="locked">man.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Him we received; and to a parish-bed,</p>
<p>Follow'd and cursed, the groaning man was led.</p>
<p class="i1">Here when they saw him, whom they used to shun,</p>
<p>A lost, lone man, so harass'd and undone,</p>
<a name="Page_499" id="Page_499" class="pagenum">[Pg 499]</a>
<p>Our gentle females, ever prompt to feel,</p>
<p>Perceived compassion on their anger steal;</p>
<p>His crimes they could not from their memories blot;</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>But they were grieved, and trembled at his lot.                </p>
<p class="i1">A priest too came, to whom his words are told;</p>
<p>And all the signs they shudder'd to behold.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p class="i1">"Look! look!" they cried; "his limbs with horror shake,</p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And as he grinds his teeth, what noise they make!            </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>How glare his angry eyes, and yet he's not awake.              </p>
<p>See! what cold drops upon his forehead stand,</p>
<p>And how he clenches that broad bony hand."</p>
<p class="i1">The priest, attending, found he spoke at times</p>
<p>As one alluding to his fears and crimes:</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>"It was the fall," he mutter'd, "I can show                    </p>
<p>The manner how&mdash;I never struck a <span class="locked">blow;"&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And then aloud&mdash;"Unhand me, free my chain;</p>
<p>On oath, he fell&mdash;it struck him to the <span class="locked">brain;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Why ask my father?&mdash;that old man will swear</p>
<p>Against my life; besides, he wasn't <span class="locked">there;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>What, all agreed?&mdash;Am I to die to-day?&mdash;</p>
<p>My Lord, in mercy, give me time to pray."</p>
<p class="i1">Then, as they watch'd him, calmer he became,</p>
<p>And grew so weak he couldn't move his frame,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>But murmuring spake&mdash;while they could see and hear             </p>
<p>The start of terror and the groan of fear;</p>
<p>See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise,</p>
<p>And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes;</p>
<p>Nor yet he died, but with unwonted force</p>
<p>Seem'd with some fancied being to discourse.</p>
<p>He knew not us, or with accustom'd art</p>
<p>He hid the knowledge, yet exposed his heart;</p>
<p>'Twas part confession and the rest defence,</p>
<p>A madman's tale, with gleams of waking sense.</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p class="i1">"I'll tell you all," he said; "the very day       </p>
<p>When the old man first placed them in my way:</p>
<p>My father's spirit&mdash;he who always tried</p>
<p>To give me trouble, when he lived and <span class="locked">died&mdash;</span></p>
<p>When he was gone, he could not be content</p>
<p>To see my days in painful labour spent,</p>
<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500" class="pagenum">[Pg 500]</a>
<p>But would appoint his meetings, and he made</p>
<p>Me watch at these, and so neglect my trade.</p>
<p class="i1">"'Twas one hot noon, all silent, still, serene;</p>
<p>No living being had I lately seen;</p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>I paddled up and down and dipp'd my net,                       </p>
<p>But (such his pleasure) I could nothing <span class="locked">get&mdash;</span></p>
<p>A father's pleasure, when his toil was done,</p>
<p>To plague and torture thus an only son!</p>
<p>And so I sat and look'd upon the stream,</p>
<p>How it ran on, and felt as in a <span class="locked">dream&mdash;</span></p>
<p>But dream it was not; no!&mdash;I fix'd my eyes</p>
<p>On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise;</p>
<p>I saw my father on the water stand,</p>
<p>And held a thin pale boy in either hand;</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>And there they glided ghastly on the top                       </p>
<p>Of the salt flood, and never touch'd a drop.</p>
<p>I would have struck them, but they knew th' intent,</p>
<p>And smiled upon the oar, and down they went.</p>
<p class="i1">"Now, from that day, whenever I began</p>
<p>To dip my net, there stood the hard old <span class="locked">man&mdash;</span></p>
<p>He and those boys; I humbled me and pray'd</p>
<p>They would be gone;&mdash;they heeded not, but stay'd.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Nor could I turn, nor would the boat go by,                  </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>But gazing on the spirits, there was I;                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>They bade me leap to death, but I was loth to die.             </p>
<p>And every day, as sure as day arose,</p>
<p>Would these three spirits meet me ere the close;</p>
<p>To hear and mark them daily was my doom,</p>
<p>And 'Come,' they said, with weak, sad voices, 'come.'</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>To row away with all my strength I try'd;                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>But there were they, hard by me in the tide,                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>The three unbodied forms&mdash;and 'Come,' still 'come,' they cried.</p>
<p class="i1">"Fathers should pity&mdash;but this old man shook</p>
<p>His hoary locks, and froze me by a look.</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Thrice, when I struck them, through the water came             </p>
<p>A hollow groan that weakened all my frame;</p>
<p>'Father!' said I, 'have mercy!'&mdash;He replied,</p>
<p>I know not what&mdash;the angry spirit <span class="locked">lied,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Didst thou not draw thy knife?' said he;&mdash;'Twas true,</p>
<a name="Page_501" id="Page_501" class="pagenum">[Pg 501]</a>
<p>But I had pity and my arm withdrew;</p>
<p>He cried for mercy which I kindly gave,</p>
<p>But he has no compassion in his grave.</p>
<p class="i1">"There were three places, where they ever <span class="locked">rose;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The whole long river has not such as <span class="locked">those&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p>Places accursed, where, if a man remain,                       </p>
<p>He'll see the things which strike him to the brain;</p>
<p>And there they made me on my paddle lean,</p>
<p>And look at them for hours&mdash;accursed scene!</p>
<p>When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space,</p>
<p>Then bid me leap and join them in the place;</p>
<p>And at my groans each little villain sprite</p>
<p>Enjoy'd my pains and vanish'd in delight.</p>
<p class="i1">"In one fierce summer-day, when my poor brain</p>
<p>Was burning hot and cruel was my pain,</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>Then came this father-foe; and there he stood                  </p>
<p>With his two boys again upon the flood;</p>
<p>There was more mischief in their eyes, more glee</p>
<p>In their pale faces when they glared at me.</p>
<p>Still did they force me on the oar to rest,</p>
<p>And when they saw me fainting and oppress'd,</p>
<p>He, with his hand, the old man, scoop'd the flood,</p>
<p>And there came flame about him, mix'd with blood;</p>
<p>He bade me stoop and look upon the place,</p>
<p>Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face;</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>Burning it blazed, and then I roar'd for pain,                 </p>
<p>I thought the demons would have turn'd my brain.</p>
<p class="i1">"Still there they stood, and forced me to behold</p>
<p>A place of horrors&mdash;they cannot be <span class="locked">told&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Where the flood open'd, there I heard the shriek</p>
<p>Of tortured guilt no earthly tongue can speak:</p>
<p>'All days alike! for ever!' did they say,</p>
<p>'And unremitted torments every day!<span class="locked">'&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Yes, so they said;"&mdash;but here he ceased and gazed</p>
<p>On all around, affrighten'd and amazed;</p>
<div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>And still he tried to speak, and look'd in dread               </p>
<p>Of frighten'd females gathering round his bed;</p>
<p>Then dropp'd exhausted and appear'd at rest,</p>
<p>Till the strong foe the vital powers possess'd;</p>
<p>Then with an inward, broken voice he cried,</p>
<p>"Again they come," and mutter'd as he died.</p>

<p class="subtitle3">PRISONS.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>'Tis well that man to all the varying states</p>
<p>Of good and ill his mind accommodates;</p>
<p>He not alone progressive grief sustains,</p>
<p>But soon submits to unexperienced pains.</p>
<p>Change after change, all climes his body bears,</p>
<p>His mind repeated shocks of changing cares;</p>
<p>Faith and fair virtue arm the nobler breast;</p>
<p>Hope and mere want of feeling aid the rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Or who could bear to lose the balmy air</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Of summer's breath, from all things fresh and fair,             </p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>With all that man admires or loves below;                    </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>All earth and water, wood and vale bestow,                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Where rosy pleasures smile, whence real blessings flow;        </p>
<p>With sight and sound of every kind that lives,</p>
<p>And crowning all with joy that freedom gives?</p>
<p class="i1">Who could from these, in some unhappy day,</p>
<p>Bear to be drawn by ruthless arms away</p>
<p>To the vile nuisance of a noisome room,</p>
<p>Where only insolence and misery come?</p>
<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504" class="pagenum">[Pg 504]</a>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>(Save that the curious will by chance appear,                   </p>
<p>Or some in pity drop a fruitless tear,)</p>
<p>To a damp prison, where the very sight</p>
<p>Of the warm sun is favour and not right;</p>
<p>Where all we hear or see the feelings shock,</p>
<p>The oath and groan, the fetter and the lock?</p>
<p class="i1">Who could bear this and live?&mdash;Oh! many a year</p>
<p>All this is borne, and miseries more severe;</p>
<p>And some there are, familiar with the scene,</p>
<p>Who live in mirth, though few become serene.</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p class="i1">Far as I might the inward man perceive,          </p>
<p>There was a constant effort&mdash;not to grieve;</p>
<p>Not to despair, for better days would come,</p>
<p>And the freed debtor smile again at home;</p>
<p>Subdued his habits, he may peace regain,</p>
<p>And bless the woes that were not sent in vain.</p>
<p class="i1">Thus might we class the debtors here confined,</p>
<p>The more deceived, the more deceitful kind;</p>
<p>Here are the guilty race, who mean to live</p>
<p>On credit, that credulity will give;</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>Who purchase, conscious they can never pay;                     </p>
<p>Who know their fate, and traffic to betray;</p>
<p>On whom no pity, fear, remorse, prevail,</p>
<p>Their aim a statute, their resource a <span class="locked">jail;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>These as the public spoilers we regard;</p>
<p>No dun so harsh, no creditor so hard.</p>
<p class="i1">A second kind are they, who truly strive</p>
<p>To keep their sinking credit long alive;</p>
<p>Success, nay prudence, they may want, but yet</p>
<p>They would be solvent, and deplore a debt;</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>All means they use, to all expedients run,                      </p>
<p>And are by slow, sad steps, at last undone.</p>
<p>Justly, perhaps, you blame their want of skill,</p>
<p>But mourn their feelings and absolve their will.</p>
<p class="i1">There is a debtor, who his trifling <i>all</i></p>
<p>Spreads in a shop; it would not fill a stall:</p>
<p>There at one window his temptation lays,</p>
<p>And in new modes disposes and displays.</p>
<p>Above the door you shall his name behold,</p>
<p>And what he vends in ample letters told,</p>
<a name="Page_505" id="Page_505" class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</a>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>The words <i>repository</i>, <i>warehouse</i>, all              </p>
<p>He uses to enlarge concerns so small.</p>
<p>He to his goods assigns some beauty's name,</p>
<p>Then in her reign, and hopes they'll share her fame;</p>
<p>And talks of credit, commerce, traffic, trade,</p>
<p>As one important by their profit made;</p>
<p>But who can paint the vacancy, the gloom,</p>
<p>And spare dimensions of one backward room?</p>
<p>Wherein he dines, if so 'tis fit to speak,</p>
<p>Of one day's herring and the morrow's steak;</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>An anchorite in diet, all his care                              </p>
<p>Is to display his stock and vend his ware.</p>
<p class="i1">Long waiting hopeless, then he tries to meet</p>
<p>A kinder fortune in a distant street;</p>
<p>There he again displays, increasing yet</p>
<p>Corroding sorrow and consuming debt:</p>
<p>Alas! he wants the requisites to <span class="locked">rise&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The true connexions, the availing ties;</p>
<p>They who proceed on certainties advance;</p>
<p>These are not times when men prevail by chance.</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>But still he tries, till, after years of pain,                  </p>
<p>He finds, with anguish, he has tried in vain.</p>
<p>Debtors are these on whom 'tis hard to press,</p>
<p>'Tis base, impolitic, and merciless.</p>
<p class="i1">To these we add a miscellaneous kind,</p>
<p>By pleasure, pride, and indolence confined;</p>
<p>Those whom no calls, no warnings could divert,</p>
<p>The unexperienced and the inexpert;</p>
<p>The builder, idler, schemer, gamester, <span class="locked">sot&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The follies different, but the same their lot;</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Victims of horses, lasses, drinking, dice,                      </p>
<p>Of every passion, humour, whim, and vice.</p>
<p class="i1">See that sad merchant, who but yesterday</p>
<p>Had a vast household in command and pay;</p>
<p>He now entreats permission to employ</p>
<p>A boy he needs, and then entreats the boy.</p>
<p class="i1">And there sits one, improvident but kind,</p>
<p>Bound for a friend, whom honour could not bind;</p>
<p>Sighing, he speaks to any who appear,</p>
<p>"A treach'rous friend&mdash;'twas that which sent me here:</p>
<a name="Page_506" id="Page_506" class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</a>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>I was too kind&mdash;I thought I could depend                       </p>
<p>On his bare word&mdash;he was a treach'rous friend."</p>
<p class="i1">A female too!&mdash;it is to her a home;</p>
<p>She came before&mdash;and she again will come.</p>
<p>Her friends have pity; when their anger drops,</p>
<p>They take her home;&mdash;she's tried her schools and <span class="locked">shops&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>Plan after plan;&mdash;but fortune would not mend,               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>She to herself was still the treach'rous friend;            </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>And wheresoe'er began, all here was sure to end.              </p>
<p class="bracket4">}</p>
<p>And there she sits as thoughtless and as gay,                </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>As if she'd means, or not a debt to pay&mdash;                      </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or knew to-morrow she'd be call'd away&mdash;                     </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>Or felt a shilling and could dine to-day.                      </p>
<p class="i1">While thus observing, I began to trace</p>
<p>The sober'd features of a well-known <span class="locked">face&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Looks once familiar, manners form'd to please,</p>
<p>And all illumined by a heart at ease.</p>
<p>But fraud and flattery ever claim'd a part</p>
<p>(Still unresisted) of that easy heart;</p>
<p>But he at length beholds me&mdash;"Ah! my friend!</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>And have thy pleasures this unlucky end?"                      </p>
<p class="i1">"Too sure," he said, and, smiling as he sigh'd:</p>
<p>"I went astray, though prudence seem'd my guide;</p>
<p>All she proposed I in my heart approved,</p>
<p>And she was honour'd, but my pleasure <span class="locked">loved&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Pleasure, the mistress to whose arms I fled,</p>
<p>From wife-like lectures angry prudence read.</p>
<p class="i1">"Why speak the madness of a life like mine,</p>
<p>The powers of beauty, novelty, and wine?</p>
<p>Why paint the wanton smile, the venal vow,</p>
<div class="linenum">130</div>
<p>Or friends whose worth I can appreciate now?                   </p>
<p class="i1">"Oft I perceived my fate, and then would say,</p>
<p>'I'll think to-morrow, I must live to-day:'</p>
<p>So am I here&mdash;I own the laws are <span class="locked">just&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And here, where thought is painful, think I must.</p>
<p>But speech is pleasant; this discourse with thee</p>
<p>Brings to my mind the sweets of liberty;</p>
<p>Breaks on the sameness of the place, and gives</p>
<p>The doubtful heart conviction that it lives,</p>
<p class="i1">"Let me describe my anguish in the hour</p>

<p>When law detained me and I felt its power.                     </p>
<p class="i1">"When in that shipwreck, this I found my shore,</p>
<p>And join'd the wretched, who were wreck'd before;</p>
<p>When I perceived each feature in the face</p>
<p>Pinch'd through neglect or turbid by disgrace;</p>
<p>When in these wasting forms affliction stood</p>
<p>In my afflicted view, it chill'd my <span class="locked">blood;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And forth I rush'd, a quick retreat to make,</p>
<p>Till a loud laugh proclaim'd the dire mistake.</p>
<p>But when the groan had settled to a sigh;</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>When gloom became familiar to the eye;                         </p>
<p>When I perceive how others seem to rest,</p>
<p>With every evil rankling in my <span class="locked">breast&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Led by example, I put on the man,</p>
<p>Sing off my sighs, and trifle as I can.</p>
<p class="i1">"Homer! nay, Pope! (for never will I seek</p>
<p>Applause for learning&mdash;nought have I with Greek&mdash;)</p>
<p>Gives us the secrets of his pagan hell,</p>
<p>Where ghost with ghost in sad communion dwell;</p>
<p>Where shade meets shade, and round the gloomy meads</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>They glide and speak of old heroic deeds&mdash;                     </p>
<p>What fields they conquer'd, and what foes they slew</p>
<p>And sent to join the melancholy crew.</p>
<p class="i1">"When a new spirit in that world was found,</p>
<p>A thousand shadowy forms came flitting round;</p>
<p>Those who had known him, fond inquiries <span class="locked">made:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Of all we left, inform us, gentle shade,</p>
<p>Now as we lead thee in our realms to dwell,</p>
<p>Our twilight groves, and meads of asphodel.'</p>
<p class="i1">"What paints the poet, is our station here,</p>
<div class="linenum">170</div>
<p>Where we like ghosts and flitting shades appear:               </p>
<p>This is the hell he sings, and here we meet,</p>
<p>And former deeds to new-made friends repeat;</p>
<p>Heroic deeds, which here obtain us fame,</p>
<p>And are in fact the causes why we came.</p>
<p>Yes! this dim region is old Homer's hell,</p>
<p>Abate but groves and meads of asphodel.</p>
<p class="i1">"Here, when a stranger from your world we spy,</p>
<p>We gather round him and for news apply;</p>
<p>He hears unheeding, nor can speech endure,</p>
<a name="Page_508" id="Page_508" class="pagenum">[Pg 508]</a>
<div class="linenum">180</div>
<p>But shivering gazes on the vast obscure.                       </p>
<p>We, smiling, pity, and by kindness show</p>
<p>We felt his feelings and his terrors know;</p>
<p>Then speak of comfort&mdash;time will give him sight,</p>
<p>Where now 'tis dark; where now 'tis wo, delight.</p>
<p class="i1">"'Have hope,' we say, 'and soon the place to thee</p>
<p>Shall not a prison but a castle be;</p>
<p>When to the wretch whom care and guilt confound,</p>
<p>The world's a prison, with a wider bound;</p>
<p>Go where he may, he feels himself confined,</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>And wears the fetters of an abject mind.'                      </p>
<p class="i1">"But now adieu! those giant keys appear,</p>
<p>Thou art not worthy to be inmate here;</p>
<p>Go to thy world, and to the young declare</p>
<p>What we, our spirits and employments, are;</p>
<p>Tell them how we the ills of life endure,</p>
<p>Our empire stable, and our state secure;</p>
<p>Our dress, our diet, for their use describe,</p>
<p>And bid them haste to join the gen'rous tribe:</p>
<p>Go to thy world, and leave us here to dwell,</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>Who to its joys and comforts bid farewell."                    </p>
<p class="i1">Farewell to these; but other scenes I view,</p>
<p>And other griefs, and guilt of deeper hue;</p>
<p>Where conscience gives to outward ills her pain,</p>
<p>Gloom to the night, and pressure to the chain.</p>
<p>Here separate cells awhile in misery keep</p>
<p>Two doom'd to suffer; there they strive for sleep;</p>
<p>By day indulged, in larger space they range,</p>
<p>Their bondage certain, but their bounds have change.</p>
<p class="i1">One was a female, who had grievous ill</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>Wrought in revenge, and she enjoy'd it still.                  </p>
<p>With death before her, and her fate in view,</p>
<p>Unsated vengeance in her bosom grew;</p>
<p>Sullen she was and threat'ning; in her eye</p>
<p>Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die;</p>
<p>But first a being in the world must <span class="locked">leave&mdash;</span></p>
<p>'Twas once reproach; 'twas now a short reprieve.</p>
<p class="i1">She was a pauper bound, who early gave</p>
<p>Her mind to vice, and doubly was a slave;</p>
<p>Upbraided, beaten, held by rough control,</p>
<a name="Page_509" id="Page_509" class="pagenum">[Pg 509]</a>
<div class="linenum">220</div>
<p>Revenge sustain'd, inspired, and fill'd her soul.              </p>
<p>She fired a full-stored barn, confess'd the fact,</p>
<p>And laugh'd at law and justified the act.</p>
<p>Our gentle vicar tried his powers in vain,</p>
<p>She answer'd not, or answer'd with disdain;</p>
<p>Th' approaching fate she heard without a sigh,</p>
<p>And neither cared to live nor fear'd to die.</p>
<p class="i1">Not so he felt, who with her was to pay</p>
<p>The forfeit, life&mdash;with dread he view'd the day,</p>
<p>And that short space which yet for him remain'd,</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>Till with his limbs his faculties were chain'd.                </p>
<p>He paced his narrow bounds some ease to find,</p>
<p>But found it not,&mdash;no comfort reached his mind.</p>
<p>Each sense was palsied; when he tasted food,</p>
<p>He sigh'd and said, "Enough&mdash;'tis very good."</p>
<p>Since his dread sentence, nothing seem'd to be</p>
<p>As once it was&mdash;he seeing could not see,</p>
<p>Nor hearing, hear aright;&mdash;when first, I came</p>
<p>Within his view, I fancied there was shame,</p>
<p>I judged, resentment; I mistook the <span class="locked">air&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>These fainter passions live not with despair,                  </p>
<p>Or but exist and die;&mdash;Hope, fear, and love,</p>
<p>Joy, doubt, and hate, may other spirits move,</p>
<p>But touch not his, who every waking hour</p>
<p>Has one fix'd dread, and always feels its power.</p>
<p class="i1">"But will not mercy?"&mdash;No! she cannot plead</p>
<p>For such an outrage;&mdash;'twas a cruel deed:</p>
<p>He stopp'd a timid traveller;&mdash;to his breast,</p>
<p>With oaths and curses, was the danger <span class="locked">press'd:&mdash;</span></p>
<p>No! he must suffer; pity we may find</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>For one man's pangs, but must not wrong mankind.               </p>
<p class="i1">Still I behold him, every thought employ'd</p>
<p>On one dire view!&mdash;all others are destroy'd;</p>
<p>This makes his features ghastly, gives the tone</p>
<p>Of his few words resemblance to a groan.</p>
<p>He takes his tasteless food, and, when 'tis done,</p>
<p>Counts up his meals, now lessen'd by that one;</p>
<p>For expectation is on time intent,</p>
<p>Whether he brings us joy or punishment.</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! e'en in sleep the impressions all remain;</p>
<a name="Page_510" id="Page_510" class="pagenum">[Pg 510]</a>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>He hears the sentence and he feels the chain;                  </p>
<p>He sees the judge and jury, when he shakes,</p>
<p>And loudly cries, "Not guilty," and awakes.</p>
<p>Then chilling tremblings o'er his body creep,</p>
<p>Till worn-out nature is compell'd to sleep.</p>
<p class="i1">Now comes the dream again; it shows each scene,</p>
<p>With each small circumstance that comes <span class="locked">between&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The call to suffering and the very <span class="locked">deed&mdash;</span></p>
<p>There crowds go with him, follow, and precede;</p>
<p>Some heartless shout, some pity, all condemn,</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>While he in fancied envy looks at them.                        </p>
<p>He seems the place for that sad act to see,</p>
<p>And dreams the very thirst which then will be;</p>
<p>A priest attends&mdash;it seems, the one he knew</p>
<p>In his best days, beneath whose care he grew.</p>
<p class="i1">At this his terrors take a sudden flight,</p>
<p>He sees his native village with delight;</p>
<p>The house, the chamber, where he once array'd</p>
<p>His youthful person; where he knelt and pray'd.</p>
<p>Then too the comforts he enjoy'd at home,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>The days of joy; the joys themselves are come&mdash;                </p>
<p>The hours of innocence&mdash;the timid look</p>
<p>Of his loved maid, when first her hand he took</p>
<p>And told his hope; her trembling joy appears,</p>
<p>Her forced reserve and his retreating fears.</p>
<p class="i1">All now is present;&mdash;'tis a moment's gleam</p>
<p>Of former sunshine&mdash;stay, delightful dream!</p>
<p>Let him within his pleasant garden walk,</p>
<p>Give him her arm, of blessings let them talk.</p>
<p class="i1">Yes! all are with him now, and all the while</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>Life's early prospects and his Fanny's smile:                  </p>
<p>Then come his sister and his village-friend,</p>
<p>And he will now the sweetest moments spend</p>
<p>Life has to yield;&mdash;no! never will he find</p>
<p>Again on earth such pleasure in his mind:</p>
<p>He goes through shrubby walks these friends among,</p>
<p>Love in their looks and honour on the tongue;</p>
<p>Nay, there's a charm beyond what nature shows,</p>
<p>The bloom is softer and more sweetly <span class="locked">grows;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Pierced by no crime, and urged by no desire</p>
<a name="Page_511" id="Page_511" class="pagenum">[Pg 511]</a>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>For more than true and honest hearts require,                  </p>
<p>They feel the calm delight, and thus proceed</p>
<p>Through the green lane&mdash;then linger in the <span class="locked">mead&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Stray o'er the heath in all its purple <span class="locked">bloom&mdash;</span></p>
<p>And pluck the blossom where the wild bees hum;</p>
<p>Then through the broomy bound with ease they pass,</p>
<p>And press the sandy sheep-walk's slender grass,</p>
<p>Where dwarfish flowers among the gorse are spread,</p>
<p>And the lamb browses by the linnet's bed;</p>
<p>Then 'cross the bounding brook they make their way</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>O'er its rough bridge&mdash;and there behold the bay!&mdash;             </p>
<p>The ocean smiling to the fervid <span class="locked">sun&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The waves that faintly fall and slowly <span class="locked">run&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The ships at distance and the boats at hand;</p>
<p>And now they walk upon the sea-side sand,</p>
<p>Counting the number and what kind they be,</p>
<p>Ships softly sinking in the sleepy sea;</p>
<p>Now arm in arm, now parted, they behold</p>
<p>The glitt'ring waters on the shingles roll'd;</p>
<p>The timid girls, half dreading their design,</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p>Dip the small foot in the retarded brine,                      </p>
<p>And search for crimson weeds, which spreading flow,</p>
<p>Or lie like pictures on the sand below;</p>
<p>With all those bright red pebbles that the sun</p>
<p>Through the small waves so softly shines upon;</p>
<p>And those live lucid jellies which the eye</p>
<p>Delights to trace as they swim glitt'ring by:</p>
<p>Pearl-shells and rubied star-fish they admire,</p>
<p>And will arrange above the parlour-<span class="locked">fire,&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Tokens of bliss!&mdash;"Oh! horrible! a wave</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>Roars as it rises&mdash;save me, Edward! save!"                     </p>
<p>She cries&mdash;Alas! the watchman on his way</p>
<p>Calls and lets in&mdash;truth, terror, and the day!</p>

<p class="subtitle3">SCHOOLS.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">To every class we have a school assign'd,</p>
<p>Rules for all ranks and food for every mind;</p>
<p>Yet one there is, that small regard to rule</p>
<p>Or study pays, and still is deem'd a school:</p>
<p>That, where a deaf, poor, patient widow sits,</p>
<p>And awes some thirty infants as she knits;</p>
<p>Infants of humble, busy wives, who pay</p>
<p>Some trifling price for freedom through the day.</p>
<p>At this good matron's hut the children meet,</p>
<div class="linenum">10</div>
<p>Who thus becomes the mother of the street.                      </p>
<p>Her room is small, they cannot widely <span class="locked">stray&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Her threshold high, they cannot run away;</p>
<p>Though deaf, she sees the rebel-heroes <span class="locked">shout;&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Though lame, her white rod nimbly walks about;</p>
<p>With band of yarn she keeps offenders in,</p>
<p>And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin.</p>
<p>Aided by these, and spells, and tell-tale birds,</p>
<p>Her power they dread and reverence her words.</p>
<p class="i1">To learning's second seats we now proceed,</p>
<div class="linenum">20</div>
<p>Where humming students gilded primers read;                     </p>
<a name="Page_514" id="Page_514" class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</a>
<p>Or books with letters large and pictures gay,</p>
<p>To make their reading but a kind of <span class="locked">play&mdash;</span></p>
<p>"Reading made Easy," so the titles tell;</p>
<p>But they who read must first begin to spell.</p>
<p>There may be profit in these arts, but still</p>
<p>Learning is labour, call it what you <span class="locked">will&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Upon the youthful mind a heavy load;</p>
<p>Nor must we hope to find the royal road.</p>
<p>Some will their easy steps to science show,</p>
<div class="linenum">30</div>
<p>And some to heav'n itself their by-way know;                    </p>
<p>Ah! trust them not;&mdash;who fame or bliss would share,</p>
<p>Must learn by labour, and must live by care.</p>
<p class="i1">Another matron of superior kind</p>
<p>For higher schools prepares the rising mind;</p>
<p><i>Preparatory</i> she her learning calls,</p>
<p>The step first made to colleges and halls.</p>
<p class="i1">She early sees to what the mind will grow,</p>
<p>Nor abler judge of infant-powers I know;</p>
<p>She sees what soon the lively will impede,</p>
<div class="linenum">40</div>
<p>And how the steadier will in turn succeed;                      </p>
<p>Observes the dawn of wisdom, fancy, taste,</p>
<p>And knows what parts will wear and what will waste:</p>
<p>She marks the mind too lively, and at once</p>
<p>Sees the gay coxcomb and the rattling dunce.</p>
<p class="i1">Long has she lived, and much she loves to trace</p>
<p>Her former pupils, now a lordly race;</p>
<p>Whom when she sees rich robes and furs bedeck,</p>
<p>She marks the pride which once she strove to check.</p>
<p>A burgess comes, and she remembers well</p>
<div class="linenum">50</div>
<p>How hard her task to make his worship spell;                    </p>
<p>Cold, selfish, dull, inanimate, unkind,</p>
<p>'Twas but by anger he display'd a mind;</p>
<p>Now civil, smiling, complaisant, and gay,</p>
<p>The world has worn th' unsocial crust away;</p>
<p>That sullen spirit now a softness wears,</p>
<p>And, save by fits, e'en dulness disappears:</p>
<p>But still the matron can the man behold,</p>
<p>Dull, selfish, hard, inanimate, and cold.</p>
<p>A merchant passes;&mdash;"probity and truth,</p>
<div class="linenum">60</div>
<p>Prudence and patience, mark'd thee from thy youth."             </p>
<a name="Page_515" id="Page_515" class="pagenum">[Pg 515]</a>
<p>Thus she observes, but oft retains her fears</p>
<p>For him, who now with name unstain'd appears;</p>
<p>Nor hope relinquishes for one who yet</p>
<p>Is lost in error and involved in debt;</p>
<p>For latent evil in that heart she found,</p>
<p>More open here, but here the core was sound.</p>
<p class="i1">Various our day-schools: here behold we one</p>
<p>Empty and still;&mdash;the morning duties done,</p>
<p>Soil'd, tatter'd, worn, and thrown in various heaps,</p>
<div class="linenum">70</div>
<p>Appear their books, and there confusion sleeps;                 </p>
<p>The workmen all are from the Babel fled,</p>
<p>And lost their tools, till the return they dread.</p>
<p>Meantime the master, with his wig awry,</p>
<p>Prepares his books for business by-and-by.</p>
<p>Now all th' insignia of the monarch laid</p>
<p>Beside him rest, and none stand by afraid;</p>
<p>He, while his troop light-hearted leap and play,</p>
<p>Is all intent on duties of the day;</p>
<p>No more the tyrant stern or judge severe,</p>
<div class="linenum">80</div>
<p>He feels the father's and the husband's fear.                   </p>
<p class="i1">Ah! little think the timid trembling crowd,</p>
<p>That one so wise, so powerful, and so proud,</p>
<p>Should feel himself, and dread the humble ills</p>
<p>Of rent-day charges and of coalman's bills;</p>
<p>That, while they mercy from their judge implore,</p>
<p>He fears himself&mdash;a knocking at the door;</p>
<p>And feels the burthen as his neighbour states</p>
<p>His humble portion to the parish-rates.</p>
<p class="i1">They sit th' allotted hours, then eager run,</p>
<div class="linenum">90</div>
<p>Rushing to pleasure when the duty's done;                       </p>
<p>His hour of leisure is of different kind,</p>
<p>Then cares domestic rush upon his mind;</p>
<p>And half the ease and comfort he enjoys,</p>
<p>Is when surrounded by slates, books, and boys.</p>
<p class="i1">Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school</p>
<p>Of ragged lads, who ever bow'd to rule;</p>
<p>Low in his price&mdash;the men who heave our coals,</p>
<p>And clean our causeways, send him boys in shoals.</p>
<p>To see poor Reuben, with his fry <span class="locked">beside&mdash;</span></p>
<div class="linenum">100</div>
<p>Their half-check'd rudeness and his half-scorn'd pride&mdash;       </p>
<a name="Page_516" id="Page_516" class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</a>
<p>Their room, the sty in which th' assembly meet,</p>
<p>In the close lane behind the Northgate-street;</p>
<p>T' observe his vain attempts to keep the peace,</p>
<p>Till tolls the bell, and strife and troubles cease,</p>
<p>Calls for our praise; his labour praise deserves,</p>
<p>But not our pity; Reuben has no nerves.</p>
<p>'Mid noise and dirt, and stench, and play, and prate,</p>
<p>He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate.</p>
<p class="i1">But Leonard!&mdash;yes, for Leonard's fate I grieve,</p>
<div class="linenum">110</div>
<p>Who loathes the station which he dares not leave;              </p>
<p>He cannot dig, he will not beg his bread;</p>
<p>All his dependence rests upon his head;</p>
<p>And, deeply skill'd in sciences and arts,</p>
<p>On vulgar lads he wastes superior parts.</p>
<p class="i1">Alas! what grief that feeling mind sustains,</p>
<p>In guiding hands and stirring torpid brains;</p>
<p>He whose proud mind from pole to pole will move,</p>
<p>And view the wonders of the worlds above;</p>
<p>Who thinks and reasons strongly&mdash;hard his fate,</p>
<div class="linenum">120</div>
<p>Confined for ever to the pen and slate.                        </p>
<p>True, he submits, and when the long dull day</p>
<p>Has slowly pass'd, in weary tasks, away,</p>
<p>To other worlds with cheerful view he looks,</p>
<p>And parts the night between repose and books.</p>
<p class="i1">Amid his labours, he has sometimes tried</p>

<p>No part conceived, a stupid boy will come;                     </p>

<p>The fair, confined, may our free crowds espy,</p>
<p>With many a stranger gazing up and down,</p>
<p>And all the envied tumult of the town;</p>
<p>May, in the smiling summer-eve, when they</p>
<p>Are sent to sleep the pleasant hours away,</p>
<p>Behold the poor (whom they conceive the bless'd)</p>
<p>Employ'd for hours, and grieved they cannot rest.</p>
<p class="i1">Here the fond girl, whose days are sad and few</p>
<p>Since dear mamma pronounced the last adieu,</p>
<div class="linenum">150</div>
<p>Looks to the road, and fondly thinks she hears                 </p>
<p>The carriage-wheels, and struggles with her tears.</p>
<p>All yet is new, the misses great and small,</p>
<p>Madam herself, and teachers, odious all;</p>
<p>From laughter, pity, nay command, she turns,</p>
<p>But melts in softness, or with anger burns;</p>
<p>Nauseates her food, and wonders who can sleep</p>
<p>On such mean beds, where she can only weep.</p>
<p>She scorns condolence&mdash;but to all she hates</p>
<p>Slowly at length her mind accommodates;</p>
<div class="linenum">160</div>
<p>Then looks on bondage with the same concern                    </p>
<p>As others felt, and finds that she must learn</p>
<p>As others learn'd&mdash;the common lot to share,</p>
<p>To search for comfort and submit to care.</p>
<p class="i1">There are, 'tis said, who on these seats attend,</p>
<p>And to these ductile minds destruction vend;</p>

<p>All hardships over, which a school contains,</p>
<p>The spirit's bondage and the body's pains;</p>
<div class="linenum">190</div>
<p>Where teachers make the heartless, trembling set               </p>
<p>Of pupils suffer for their own regret;</p>
<p>Where winter's cold, attack'd by one poor fire,</p>
<p>Chills the fair child, commanded to retire;</p>
<p>She felt it keenly in the morning air,</p>
<p>Keenly she felt it at the evening prayer.</p>
<p>More pleasant summer; but then walks were made</p>
<p>Not a sweet ramble, but a slow parade;</p>
<p>They moved by pairs beside the hawthorn-hedge,</p>
<p>Only to set their feelings on an edge;</p>
<div class="linenum">200</div>
<p>And now at eve, when all their spirits rise,                   </p>
<p>Are sent to rest, and all their pleasure dies;</p>
<p>Where yet they all the town alert can see,</p>
<p>And distant plough-boys pacing o'er the lea.</p>
<p class="i1">These and the tasks successive masters <span class="locked">brought&mdash;</span></p>
<p>The French they conn'd, the curious works they wrought,</p>
<p>The hours they made their taper fingers strike,</p>
<p>Note after note, all dull to them alike;</p>
<p>Their drawings, dancings on appointed days,</p>
<p>Playing with globes, and getting parts of plays;</p>
<div class="linenum">210</div>
<p>The tender friendships made 'twixt heart and heart,            </p>
<p>When the dear friends had nothing to <span class="locked">impart:&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i1">All! all! are over;&mdash;now th' accomplished maid</p>
<p>Longs for the world, of nothing there afraid.</p>
<p>Dreams of delight invade her gentle breast,</p>
<p>And fancied lovers rob the heart of rest;</p>
<p>At the paternal door a carriage stands,</p>
<p>Love knits their hearts, and Hymen joins their hands.</p>
<p class="i1">Ah!&mdash;world unknown! how charming is thy view,</p>
<p>Thy pleasures many, and each pleasure new!</p>
<div class="linenum">220</div>

<a name="Page_519" id="Page_519" class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</a>
<p>How few thy pleasures, and those few how old!</p>
<p class="i1">Within a silent street, and far apart</p>
<p>From noise of business, from a quay or mart,</p>
<p>Stands an old spacious building, and the din</p>
<p>You hear without, explains the work within;</p>
<p>Unlike the whispering of the nymphs, this noise</p>
<p>Loudly proclaims a "boarding-school for boys."</p>
<p>The master heeds it not, for thirty years</p>
<p>Have render'd all familiar to his ears;</p>
<div class="linenum">230</div>
<p>He sits in comfort, 'mid the various sound                     </p>
<p>Of mingled tones for ever flowing round;</p>
<p>Day after day he to his task <span class="locked">attends&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Unvaried toil, and care that never ends.</p>
<p>Boys in their works proceed; while his employ</p>
<p>Admits no change, or changes but the boy;</p>
<p>Yet time has made it easy;&mdash;he beside</p>
<p>Has power supreme, and power is sweet to pride.</p>
<p>But grant him pleasure;&mdash;what can teachers feel,</p>
<p>Dependent helpers always at the wheel?</p>
<div class="linenum">240</div>
<p>Their power despised, their compensation small,                </p>
<p>Their labour dull, their life laborious all;</p>
<p>Set after set, the lower lads to make</p>
<p>Fit for the class which their superiors take;</p>
<p>The road of learning for a time to track</p>
<p>In roughest state, and then again go back;</p>
<p>Just the same way on other troops to <span class="locked">wait&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Attendants fix'd at learning's lower gate.</p>
<p class="i1">The day-tasks now are over;&mdash;to their ground</p>
<p>Rush the gay crowd with joy-compelling sound;</p>
<div class="linenum">250</div>
<p>Glad to [elude] the burthens of the day,                       </p>
<p>The eager parties hurry to their play.</p>
<p>Then in these hours of liberty we find</p>
<p>The native bias of the opening mind;</p>
<p>They yet possess not skill the mask to place,</p>
<p>And hide the passions glowing in the face;</p>
<p>Yet some are found&mdash;the close, the sly, the mean,</p>
<p>Who know already all must not be seen.</p>
<p class="i1">Lo! one who walks apart, although so young,</p>
<p>He lays restraint upon his eye and tongue;</p>
<div class="linenum">260</div>
<p>Nor will he into scrapes or dangers get,                       </p>
<a name="Page_520" id="Page_520" class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</a>
<p>And half the school are in the stripling's debt.</p>
<p>Suspicious, timid, he is much afraid</p>
<p>Of trick and plot&mdash;he dreads to be betray'd;</p>
<p>He shuns all friendship, for he finds they lend,</p>
<p>When lads begin to call each other friend.</p>
<p>Yet self with self has war; the tempting sight</p>
<p>Of fruit on sale provokes his <span class="locked">appetite;&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>See! how, he walks the sweet seduction by;                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>That he is tempted, costs him first a sigh&mdash;                 </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<div class="linenum">270</div>
<p>'Tis dangerous to indulge, 'tis grievous to deny!              </p>
<p>This he will choose, and whispering asks the price.</p>
<p>The purchase dreadful, but the portion nice;</p>
<p>Within the pocket he explores the pence;</p>
<p>Without, temptation strikes on either sense,</p>
<p>The sight, the smell;&mdash;but then he thinks again</p>
<p>Of money gone! while fruit nor taste remain.</p>
<p>Meantime there comes an eager thoughtless boy,</p>
<p>Who gives the price and only feels the joy:</p>
<p>Example dire! the youthful miser stops,</p>
<div class="linenum">280</div>
<p>And slowly back the treasured coinage drops.                   </p>
<p>Heroic deed! for should he now comply,</p>
<p>Can he to-morrow's appetite deny?</p>
<p>Beside, these spendthrifts who so friendly live,</p>
<p>Cloy'd with their purchase, will a portion <span class="locked">give.&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Here ends debate, he buttons up his store,</p>
<p>And feels the comfort that it burns no more,</p>
<p class="i1">Unlike to him the tyrant-boy, whose sway</p>
<p>All hearts acknowledge; him the crowds obey:</p>
<p>At his command they break through every rule;</p>
<div class="linenum">290</div>
<p>Whoever governs, he controls the school;                       </p>
<p>'Tis not the distant emperor moves their fear,</p>
<p>But the proud viceroy who is ever near.</p>
<p class="i1">Verres could do that mischief in a day,</p>
<p>For which not Rome, in all its power, could pay;</p>
<p>And these boy-tyrants will their slaves distress,</p>
<p>And do the wrongs no master can redress.</p>
<p class="bracket">}</p>
<p>The mind they load with fear; it feels disdain               </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>For its own baseness; yet it tries in vain                   </p>
<p class="bracketnv">}</p>
<p>To shake th' admitted power;&mdash;the coward comes again.          </p>
<div class="linenum">300</div>
<p>'Tis more than present pain these tyrants give,                </p>

<p>Long as we've life some strong impressions live;</p>
<p>And these young ruffians in the soul will sow</p>
<p>Seeds of all vices that on weakness grow.</p>
<p class="i1">Hark! at his word the trembling younglings flee;</p>
<p>Where he is walking none must walk but he;</p>
<p>See! from the winter-fire the weak retreat;</p>
<p>His the warm corner, his the favourite seat,</p>
<p>Save when he yields it to some slave to keep</p>
<p>Awhile, then back, at his return, to creep.</p>
<div class="linenum">310</div>
<p>At his command his poor dependents fly,                        </p>
<p>And humbly bribe him as a proud ally;</p>
<p>Flatter'd by all, the notice he bestows</p>
<p>Is gross abuse, and bantering and blows;</p>
<p>Yet he's a dunce, and, spite of all his fame</p>
<p>Without the desk, within he feels his shame:</p>
<p>For there the weaker boy, who felt his scorn,</p>
<p>For him corrects the blunders of the morn;</p>
<p>And he is taught, unpleasant truth! to find</p>
<p>The trembling body has the prouder mind.</p>
<div class="linenum">320</div>
<p class="i1">Hark to that shout, that burst of empty noise,      </p>
<p>From a rude set of bluff, obstreperous boys;</p>
<p>They who, like colts let loose, with vigour bound,</p>
<p>And thoughtless spirit, o'er the beaten ground;</p>
<p>Fearless they leap, and every youngster feels</p>
<p>His Alma active in his hands and heels.</p>
<p class="i1">These are the sons of farmers, and they come</p>
<p>With partial fondness for the joys of home;</p>
<p>Their minds are coursing in their fathers' fields,</p>
<p>And e'en the dream a lively pleasure yields;</p>
<div class="linenum">330</div>
<p>They, much enduring, sit th' allotted hours,                   </p>
<p>And o'er a grammar waste their sprightly powers;</p>
<p>They dance; but them can measured steps delight,</p>
<p>Whom horse and hounds to daring deeds excite?</p>
<p>Nor could they bare to wait from meal to meal,</p>
<p>Did they not slyly to the chamber steal,</p>
<p>And there the produce of the basket seize,</p>
<p>The mother's gift! still studious of their ease.</p>
<p>Poor Alma, thus oppress'd, forbears to rise,</p>

<div class="linenum">340</div>
<p class="i1">"But is it sure that study will repay          </p>
<p>The more attentive and forbearing?"&mdash;Nay!</p>
<p>The farm, the ship, the humble shop have each</p>
<p>Gains which severest studies seldom reach.</p>
<p class="i1">At college place a youth, who means to raise</p>
<p>His state by merit and his name by praise;</p>
<p>Still much he hazards; there is serious strife</p>
<p>In the contentions of a scholar's life.</p>
<p>Not all the mind's attention, care, distress,</p>
<p>Nor diligence itself, ensure success;</p>
<div class="linenum">350</div>
<p>His jealous heart a rival's power may dread,                   </p>
<p>Till its strong feelings have confused his head,</p>
<p>And, after days and months, nay, years of pain,</p>
<p>He finds just lost the object he would gain.</p>
<p class="i1">But, grant him this and all such life can give,</p>
<p>For other prospects he begins to live;</p>
<p>Begins to feel that man was form'd to look</p>
<p>And long for other objects than a book.</p>
<p>In his mind's eye his house and glebe he sees,</p>
<p>And farms and talks with farmers at his ease;</p>
<div class="linenum">360</div>
<p>And time is lost, till fortune sends him forth                 </p>
<p>To a rude world unconscious of his worth;</p>
<p>There in some petty parish to reside,</p>
<p>The college-boast, then turn'd the village-guide;</p>
<p>And, though awhile his flock and dairy please,</p>
<p>He soon reverts to former joys and ease:</p>
<p>Glad when a friend shall come to break his rest,</p>
<p>And speak of all the pleasures they <span class="locked">possess'd&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Of masters, fellows, tutors, all with whom</p>
<p>They shared those pleasures, never more to come;</p>
<div class="linenum">370</div>
<p>Till both conceive the times by bliss endear'd,                </p>
<p>Which once so dismal and so dull appear'd.</p>
<p class="i1">But fix our scholar, and suppose him crown'd</p>
<p>With all the glory gain'd on classic ground;</p>
<p>Suppose the world without a sigh resign'd,</p>
<p>And to his college all his care confined;</p>
<p>Give him all honours that such states allow,</p>
<p>The freshman's terror and the tradesman's bow;</p>
<p>Let his apartments with his taste agree,</p>
<p>And all his views be those he loves to see;</p>
<a name="Page_523" id="Page_523" class="pagenum">[Pg 523]</a>
<div class="linenum">380</div>
<p>Let him each day behold the savoury treat,                     </p>
<p>For which he pays not, but is paid to eat;</p>
<p>These joys and glories soon delight no more,</p>
<p>Although, withheld, the mind is vex'd and sore;</p>
<p>The honour too is to the place confined;</p>
<p>Abroad they know not each superior mind:</p>
<p>Strangers no <i>wranglers</i> in these figures see,</p>
<p>Nor give they worship to a high degree.</p>
<p>Unlike the prophet's is the scholar's case,</p>
<p>His honour all is in his dwelling-place;</p>
<div class="linenum">390</div>
<p>And there such honours are familiar things;                    </p>
<p>What is a monarch in a crowd of kings?</p>
<p>Like other sovereigns he's by forms address'd,</p>
<p>By statutes govern'd and with rules oppress'd.</p>
<p class="i1">When all these forms and duties die away,</p>
<p>And the day passes like the former day,</p>
<p>Then, of exterior things at once bereft,</p>
<p>He's to himself and one attendant left;</p>
<p>Nay, John too goes; nor aught of service more</p>
<p>Remains for him; he gladly quits the door,</p>
<div class="linenum">400</div>
<p>And, as he whistles to the college-gate,                       </p>
<p>He kindly pities his poor master's fate.</p>
<p class="i1">Books cannot always please, however good;</p>
<p>Minds are not ever craving for their food;</p>
<p>But sleep will soon the weary soul prepare</p>
<p>For cares to-morrow that were this day's care;</p>
<p>For forms, for feasts, that sundry times have past,</p>
<p>And formal feasts that will for ever last.</p>
<p class="i1">"But then from study will no comforts rise?"</p>
<p>Yes! such as studious minds alone can prize;</p>
<div class="linenum">410</div>
<p>Comforts, yea! joys ineffable they find,                       </p>
<p>Who seek the prouder pleasures of the mind:</p>
<p>The soul, collected in those happy hours,</p>
<p>Then makes her efforts, then enjoys her powers;</p>
<p>And in those seasons feels herself repaid,</p>
<p>For labours past and honours long delay'd.</p>
<p class="i1">No! 'tis not worldly gain, although by chance</p>
<p>The sons of learning may to wealth advance;</p>
<p>Nor station high, though in some favouring hour</p>
<p>The sons of learning may arrive at power;</p>
<div class="linenum">420</div>
<p>Nor is it glory, though the public voice                       </p>
<a name="Page_524" id="Page_524" class="pagenum">[Pg 524]</a>
<p>Of honest praise will make the heart rejoice;</p>
<p>But 'tis the mind's own feelings give the joy,</p>
<p>Pleasures she gathers in her own <span class="locked">employ&mdash;</span></p>
<p>Pleasures that gain or praise cannot bestow,</p>
<p>Yet can dilate and raise them when they flow.</p>
<p class="i1">For this the poet looks the world around,</p>
<p>Where form and life and reasoning man are found.</p>
<p>He loves the mind in all its modes to trace,</p>
<p>And all the manners of the changing race;</p>
<div class="linenum">430</div>
<p>Silent he walks the road of life along,                        </p>
<p>And views the aims of its tumultuous throng;</p>
<p>He finds what shapes the Proteus-passions take,</p>
<p>And what strange waste of life and joy they make,</p>
<p>And loves to show them in their varied ways,</p>
<p>With honest blame or with unflattering praise.</p>
<p>'Tis good to know, 'tis pleasant to impart,</p>

    <p>Fie, Nathan! fie! to let a sprightly Jade</p>

    <p>And lingering walk around at Head and Feet,</p>

    <p>(A Thought she knew, and thou could'st not send hence,</p>
    <p>Well as thou lov'dst them, for ten thousand Pence!)</p>
    <p>And thus with some bold Hint she would retire,</p>
    <p>That wak'd the idle Wish and stirr'd the slumbering Fire;</p>

    <p>And Doubts on Doubts arise, and Fears on Fears;</p>
    <p>Yet Fear defy, and be of Courage stout,</p>
